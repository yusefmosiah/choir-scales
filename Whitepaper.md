## **Introduction**

In the digital landscape, the proliferation of content has democratized information sharing but has also introduced challenges related to content quality, credibility, and meaningful collaboration. Traditional social media platforms often rely on centralized algorithms that prioritize engagement over substance, leading to issues like misinformation and low-quality content proliferation.

Choir addresses these challenges by creating a decentralized platform where content and its metadata are treated as valuable assets. By integrating blockchain technology and a thoughtfully designed token economy, Choir incentivizes users to produce original, high-quality content, engage in collaborative editing, and invest in the platform's growth. The introduction of an interactive Authors Chat during edit proposals further enhances collaboration, allowing authors and editors to discuss, refine, and reach consensus on content improvements through a seamless user interface. This approach not only enhances content quality but also fosters a vibrant, engaged community.

## **Token Distribution Mechanisms**

### **1. Initial Token Allocation**

- **Total Tokens**: 10 billion CHOIR tokens.
- **Allocation**: Entirely minted to the Choir Treasury at platform inception.
- **Purpose**: Serves as the foundational economic resource for rewarding user activities and maintaining platform operations.

### **2. Content Creation Rewards**

- **Mechanism**: Users earn tokens by creating original content.
- **Variable Reward System**:
  - **Semantic Sparsity Factor**: The reward for content creation is inversely proportional to the density of similar content in the semantic space.
  - **High-Entropy Content Incentivization**: Unique, high-quality, and innovative content receives higher rewards, promoting diversity and originality.

- **Formula**:

  \[
  \text{Reward} = T_c \times \left(1 + \frac{S_{\text{max}} - S_{\text{content}}}{S_{\text{max}}} \right)
  \]

  - \( T_c \): Base token reward per content creation.
  - \( S_{\text{content}} \): Semantic similarity score of the new content to existing content.
  - \( S_{\text{max}} \): Maximum possible similarity score.

- **Token Allocation**:
  - **Creators**: Receive a portion of the minted tokens based on content uniqueness.
  - **Content's Token Balance**: Accumulates tokens, enhancing content visibility and ranking.

### **3. Automatic Citation Rewards**

- **Mechanism**: When new content is created, the system automatically cites relevant existing content using a reranking algorithm.
- **User Interface Integration**:
  - **Chat Threads**: Citations appear as new messages in the chat thread of the cited content.
  - **Notification Indicators**: Tabs or chat threads change color or display badges to indicate new unread citation messages.
- **Token Distribution**:
  - **Cited Authors**: Receive tokens as a reward for their content being referenced.
  - **Allocation Ratio**: A predefined fraction of the content creation reward is allocated for citations.

- **Example**:
  - If 50% of the content creation reward is designated for citations, this portion is distributed among all cited authors proportionally based on relevance.

### **4. Collaborative Editing and Token Investment**

- **Edit Proposals**:
  - **Process**: Users propose edits to existing content by staking tokens in an edit escrow contract.
  - **Staking Requirement**: A fixed number of tokens must be staked to initiate an edit proposal, representing an investment in the content's improvement.

- **User Interface and Authors Chat**:
  - **Edit Requests as Chat Messages**:
    - **Appearance**: Edit requests appear as new messages in the chat thread of the content being edited.
    - **Interactive Elements**: Messages include discrete options or buttons for authors to tap/click, such as approve or reject.
  - **Notification System**:
    - **Visual Indicators**: Tabs or chat threads highlight new edit requests through color changes or notification badges.
    - **Email/App Notifications**: Authors receive notifications about new edit requests and messages.
  - **Communication and Collaboration**:
    - **Responses**: Authors can respond to edit requests within the chat thread, engaging in discussion.
    - **Cross-Thread Updates**: Responses are mirrored in the chat threads of all involved parties, ensuring synchronized communication.

- **Approval Process**:
  - **Review Window**: Co-authors have a 7-day period to approve or reject the proposed edit.
  - **Abstention Rule**: If co-authors neither approve nor reject within 7 days, their abstention is treated as an implicit approval.

- **Token Distribution Based on Outcomes**:
  - **Approval (Explicit or Implicit)**:
    - **Content's Token Balance**: Receives the staked tokens, enhancing content's visibility and ranking.
    - **Editor**: Becomes a co-author, gaining veto power over future edits.
  - **Denial**:
    - **Rejecting Authors**: Receive a portion of the staked tokens as a reward for maintaining content integrity.
    - **Editor**: Loses the staked tokens.

- **Divestment Mechanism**:
  - **Process**: Authors can divest their share of tokens from a content account, relinquishing authorship.
  - **Token Retrieval**:
    - **Formula**: An author can divest and receive \(\frac{\text{Content Account Tokens}}{n - 1}\) tokens, where \(n\) is the total number of authors.
    - **Example**:
      - If there are 7 authors, an author divesting receives \(\frac{\text{Content Tokens}}{6}\).
      - If there are 2 authors, the divesting author receives all tokens, leaving the remaining author with an empty account.

- **Economic Gamification**:
  - **Buyable Assets**: Content can be invested in through collaborative editing, representing shared ownership.
  - **Sellable Assets**: Authors can divest their share, transferring control to those who value the content's future.
  - **Hot Potato Nature**: Encourages active investment and discourages passive ownership, promoting a dynamic content ecosystem.
