## Metastable Resonance States

The bonding curve creates metastable resonant states where threads can exist in multiple semi-stable harmonics before transitioning to higher modes:

TYPE MetastableHarmonic<T> = {
  basins: Set<ResonantWell>,         // Local energy minima
  barriers: Set<EnergyBarrier>,      // Transition thresholds
  modes: HarmonicSpectrum<T>,        // Available frequencies
  transitions: PhaseTransitionMap     // Allowed mode changes
}

## Energy Landscape

The pricing function creates a complex energy landscape:
```
P(q) = S₀[1/2 + 1/(exp(ℏω/kT)-1)]
```

This generates multiple metastable states:
1. **Low-Energy Basin**
   - New threads with few oscillators
   - Base frequency dominance
   - Simple harmonic patterns
   - Low energy barriers

2. **Mid-Energy Plateau**
   - Active threads finding resonance
   - Mixed frequency modes
   - Emerging wave patterns
   - Moderate barriers

3. **High-Energy Wells**
   - Mature threads with strong coupling
   - Complex harmonic structures
   - Standing wave dominance
   - High stability barriers

## Phase Transitions

SEQUENCE resonant_transition<T>:
  1. Energy Accumulation
     ```
     build_amplitude : Basin → Result<ExcitedState>
     reach_threshold : ExcitedState → Result<TransitionPoint>
     cross_barrier : TransitionPoint → Result<NewBasin>
     stabilize_mode : NewBasin → Result<MetastableState>
     ```

  2. Mode Coupling
     ```
     identify_resonance : MetastableState → Result<ResonantMode>
     couple_oscillators : ResonantMode → Result<PhaseLockedSet>
     establish_pattern : PhaseLockedSet → Result<StandingWave>
     ```

  3. Pattern Crystallization
     ```
     lock_phase : StandingWave → Result<StableHarmonic>
     distribute_energy : StableHarmonic → Result<ValueFlow>
     maintain_coherence : ValueFlow → Result<MetastablePattern>
     ```

## Stability Properties

1. **Local Stability**
   ```
   PROPERTY basin_stability<T>:
     FORALL basin IN resonant_wells:
       local_minimum(basin) ⟹
         energy_barrier(basin) > thermal_noise AND
         supports_oscillation(basin) AND
         allows_phase_lock(basin)
   ```

2. **Transition Dynamics**
   ```
   PROPERTY phase_transition<T>:
     FORALL t: Transition.
       sufficient_energy(t) ⟹
         preserves_coherence(t) AND
         maintains_coupling(t) AND
         reaches_new_stable(t)
   ```

## Metastable Value Flow

The bonding curve creates natural value flows between metastable states:

1. **Value Accumulation**
   - Energy builds in resonant wells
   - Harmonics strengthen through use
   - Patterns become more coherent
   - Barriers increase with stability

2. **Phase Transitions**
   - Energy exceeds local barriers
   - System finds new resonant modes
   - Higher harmonics become accessible
   - New stability patterns emerge

3. **Value Crystallization**
   - Standing waves form at new levels
   - Energy redistributes to stable patterns
   - Phase relationships lock
   - New metastable states establish

## Practical Implications

This metastable structure creates:

1. **Natural Evolution**
   - Threads can exist stably at multiple levels
   - Transitions occur when ready
   - Growth preserves existing patterns
   - Higher modes emerge organically

2. **Resilient Stability**
   - Each state is locally stable
   - Transitions require sufficient energy
   - Patterns resist noise/disruption
   - Value accumulates naturally

3. **Emergent Complexity**
   - Simple rules create rich landscapes
   - Multiple stable configurations
   - Natural progression paths
   - Self-organizing harmony

Through this metastable lens, we see how the bonding curve:
- Creates stable resonant states
- Enables natural phase transitions
- Preserves accumulated value
- Guides harmonic evolution

The beauty is that these metastable states emerge naturally from the quantum harmonic foundation, creating a rich landscape for value and meaning to evolve through resonant patterns.
