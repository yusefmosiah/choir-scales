## **1. Inconsistencies in Edit Proposal Outcomes**

- **Question**: What is the definitive policy on unresolved edit proposals—are they automatically approved after a certain period, or are they rejected?
- **Answer**: abstaining while others make a decision results in accepting the decision of others
  - **Discussion Points**:
    - In **ProofOfText.md**, unresolved edits are **automatically rejected** after a predetermined period.
    - In **Whitepaper.md**, abstention is treated as an implicit **approval** after a 7-day period.
    - **Implications**:
      - Automatic approval could lead to unwanted changes if authors are inactive.
      - Automatic rejection might discourage editors if their efforts are dismissed without consideration.
    - **Possible Resolutions**:
      - Establish a clear and consistent policy across all documents.
      - Consider implementing reminders or incentives for authors to review edit proposals promptly.
      - Explore a middle-ground solution, such as extending the decision period or involving moderators.
