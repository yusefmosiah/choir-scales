## Phase 1: Infrastructure Setup

- [ ] Rebase and Deploy create-solana-dapp
  - [ ] Switch to pnpm
  - [ ] Setup Docker containerization
  - [ ] Configure CI/CD pipeline
  - [ ] Deploy to Azure

## Phase 2: Documentation Gaps

- [ ] Deployment Documentation
  - [ ] Infrastructure setup
  - [ ] Environment configuration
  - [ ] Deployment procedures
  - [ ] Rollback processes

- [ ] API Documentation
  - [ ] WebSocket protocol
  - [ ] REST endpoints
  - [ ] Authentication flows
  - [ ] Rate limiting

- [ ] Testing Documentation
  - [ ] Unit testing strategy
  - [ ] Integration testing
  - [ ] Bankrun test patterns
  - [ ] Trident fuzzing

- [ ] Monitoring Documentation
  - [ ] System metrics
  - [ ] User analytics
  - [ ] Error tracking
  - [ ] Performance monitoring

## Phase 3: Core Implementation

- [ ] Iterative Development
  - [ ] Document feature
  - [ ] Write tests
  - [ ] Implement code
  - [ ] Deploy and verify

### Core Features Priority

   - [ ] Approval distribution
   - [ ] Balance management
   - [ ] Divestment process

3. Content Management
   - [ ] Content storage
   - [ ] Embedding generation
   - [ ] Search functionality
   - [ ] Privacy controls

4. Real-time Communication
   - [ ] WebSocket connections
   - [ ] Event propagation
   - [ ] State synchronization
   - [ ] Error recovery

## Documentation Strategy

Each feature will follow this documentation flow:
```
SEQUENCE doc_implementation:
  1. Update theoretical docs
  2. Write implementation specs
  3. Document testing approach
  4. Add deployment notes
  5. Include monitoring guidance
```

## Testing Strategy

Each feature requires:
```
SEQUENCE test_implementation:
  1. Unit tests (Bankrun)
  2. Integration tests
  3. Fuzz testing (Trident)
  4. Performance testing
  5. Security verification
```

## Deployment Strategy

Each deployment includes:
```
SEQUENCE deployment_flow:
  1. Environment preparation
  2. Security review
  3. Staged rollout
  4. Monitoring setup
  5. Performance verification
```

## Success Criteria

Feature is complete when:
- Documentation is comprehensive
- Tests are passing
- Code is deployed
- Monitoring is active
- Performance meets SLAs

Through this iterative process, we'll build a robust, well-documented system while maintaining high quality standards.
