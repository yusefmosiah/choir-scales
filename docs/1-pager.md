# Choir: Revolutionizing AI through Collaborative Chat and Tokenomics

---

## Mission
To create the world's highest signal human dataset by leveraging a decentralized, token-driven chat platform, ultimately developing AI models that excel in qualitative, stylistic, and artistic dimensions.

---

## The Problem
Traditional AI models lack the qualitative nuances that characterize human expression, often failing to capture stylistic nuance, artistic flair, and meaningful context.

## The Solution: Choir (30-Day MVP Focus)
Choir is a decentralized, chat-based platform where users engage in collaborative discussions. For the MVP, we're focusing on:

1. **Collaborative Message Ownership and Basic Approval**
   - Users own the messages they submit.
   - Basic co-authorship system for threads.
   - Simplified approval mechanism for messages.

2. **Basic Access Control and Incentivization**
   - Co-authors have read-write access to their threads.
   - Simplified token staking for message submissions.

3. **Mock CHOIR Token Mechanics**
   - Basic token distribution for approvals/denials.
   - Simplified Solana wallet integration.

4. **AI-Generated Summaries**
   - Basic summaries for non-co-authors.

5. **Simplified Chorus Loop**
   - Implementation of all steps (Action, Experience, Intention, Observation, Update, Final).
   - Focus on essential functionality for MVP.
