# **Choir Project: 1-Pager Overview**

## **Project Overview**
**Choir** is a pioneering decentralized socioeconomic media network that harnesses blockchain (Solana) and artificial intelligence (AI) technologies to revolutionize content creation, curation, and collaboration. The platform is dedicated to constructing the world's highest signal human dataset, serving as the bedrock for training advanced AI models with superior qualitative and stylistic capabilities.

## **Vision Statement**
Choir envisions a future where high-quality, meaningful content is both incentivized and rewarded through blockchain-based tokenomics. By cultivating a collaborative environment, Choir aims to establish a sustainable ecosystem that empowers creators, enhances content reliability, and drives the evolution of sophisticated AI models.

## **Key Features**

### **Chorus AI System**
- **Advanced AI Process:** Implements a multi-step AI workflow—Action, Experience, Intention, Observation, Update, and Yield—to ensure comprehensive content analysis and generation.
- **Semantic Search Integration:** Utilizes the Qdrant vector database for efficient semantic search and content management.
- **Enhanced Response Quality:** Features include inline citations and improved response accuracy, elevating overall user interactions.

### **Tokenomics (CHOIR Token)**
- **Total Supply:** Fixed at 10,000,000,000 CHOIR tokens (Hard Cap).
- **Distribution Strategy:**
  - **Initial Allocation:** Entire supply minted to the Choir Treasury at inception.
  - **Rewards Distribution:** Tokens distributed as incentives for content creation, citations, and collaborative editing.
  - **Sustainability Mechanisms:** Token recapture systems ensure ongoing circulation and economic balance.

### **Content Management**
- **Edit Proposal & Approval:** Users can propose edits by staking CHOIR tokens, fostering meaningful and accountable content contributions.
- **Collaborative Editing:** Authors and editors refine content through the integrated Authors Chat system, promoting collective quality enhancement.
- **Divestment Mechanism:** Authors can relinquish authorship and divest their token shares, ensuring dynamic content ownership.

### **Blockchain Integration**
- **Solana Wallet Integration:** Seamless authentication and transaction capabilities via the Solana wallet.
- **Smart Contracts:** Robust Solana-based programs manage token distribution and platform operations efficiently.

### **User Interface & Experience**
- **Responsive Design:** Dark-themed, chat-like layout developed with Tailwind CSS for optimal user interaction across devices.
- **Intuitive Navigation:** Features include chat thread tabs, Authors Chat, and a user dashboard, enhancing overall user engagement.
- **Accessibility:** Planned enhancements focus on improved accessibility, catering to a diverse user base.

### **Governance**
- **Decentralized Decision-Making:** CHOIR tokens empower the community to propose and vote on platform decisions.
- **Phased Integration:** Governance features are to be rolled out post-MVP, ensuring robustness and active community participation.

## **Tokenomics Summary**
- **Initial Allocation:** 10 billion CHOIR tokens held by the Choir Treasury.
- **Distribution Channels:**
  - **Content Creation:** Rewards based on content uniqueness and quality.
  - **Citations:** Tokens awarded to authors of cited works, incentivizing proper referencing.
  - **Edit Proposals:** Staked tokens redistributed based on approval outcomes.
- **Sustainability Measures:**
  - Fixed token supply ensures scarcity and prevents inflation.
  - Token recapture from split edit decisions maintains balanced circulation.
  - Absence of in-protocol burning promotes long-term economic stability.
