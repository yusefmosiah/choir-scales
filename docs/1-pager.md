# Choir: Revolutionizing AI through Collaborative Chat and Tokenomics

---

**Mission**: To create the world's highest signal human dataset by leveraging a decentralized, token-driven chat platform, ultimately developing AI models that excel in qualitative, stylistic, and artistic dimensions.

---

## The Problem

Traditional AI models demonstrate impressive technical capabilities but lack the qualitative nuances that characterize human expression. Content generated by these models often fails to capture stylistic nuance, artistic flair, and meaningful context, resulting in a disconnect with human audiences.

## The Solution: Choir

**Choir** is a decentralized, chat-based platform where users engage in collaborative discussions. Messages are curated through a collective approval mechanism, ensuring only high-quality content is published. By integrating blockchain technology and innovative tokenomics, Choir incentivizes users to produce valuable content, fostering an ecosystem that prioritizes quality over quantity.

### Key Features

- **Collaborative Message Approval**

  - Users contribute messages by staking CHOIR tokens.
  - Messages require unanimous approval from co-authors to be published.
  - Approved contributors become co-authors, gaining rights and token shares.

- **CHOIR Token Mechanics**

  - Tokens are used for staking, rewarding contributions, and aligning incentives.
  - A fixed supply ensures scarcity and value preservation.

- **AI-Generated Summaries**

  - Non-co-authors access AI-generated summaries of threads.
  - Summaries are co-author approved to ensure accuracy and privacy.

## How It Works

1. **Message Contribution**

   - Users stake CHOIR tokens to submit messages to threads where they are not co-authors.
   - Staked tokens are held in escrow during the approval process.

2. **Approval Mechanism**

   - Co-authors have a 7-day window to approve or deny messages.
   - **Unanimous Approval**: Message is published; the contributor becomes a co-author.
   - **Denial**: Message is rejected; staked tokens are distributed among rejecting co-authors.
   - **Split Decision**: Message is denied; tokens intended for approvers return to the Choir Treasury.

3. **Co-authorship and Token Dynamics**

   - Co-authors share in the thread's token balance and have approval rights.
   - Co-authors can divest their token share at any time.

## The Benefits

- **High-Quality Content**: The approval mechanism ensures only valuable messages are published.
- **Incentivized Collaboration**: Tokenomics align user incentives with platform goals.
- **AI Advancement**: The curated dataset serves as ideal training data for advanced AI models.
- **Community Empowerment**: Users have direct influence over content and platform evolution.

## Roadmap Highlights

- **October 2024**: Launch of the MVP with core functionalities.
- **April 2025**: Release of the first AI model trained on the token-scored dataset.
- **Beyond**: Expansion of platform features, governance integration, and continuous AI development.
