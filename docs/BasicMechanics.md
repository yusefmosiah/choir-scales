Choir is a chat platform where you actually own your messages and can earn tokens for quality contributions. Let's break down how it works in simple terms:

## Basic Functionality

When you start using Choir, you'll find it familiar yet unique. You can join existing chat threads or start new ones. The key difference is that messages require approval from everyone participating in the thread - we call these participants "co-authors."

Think of a thread like a shared document where everyone who's contributed good content has a say in what gets added next. When you write a message that gets approved, you become a co-author of that thread. This means you'll help decide on future additions too.

## Token System

Choir uses tokens in a straightforward way. When you want to contribute to a thread where you're not yet a co-author, you'll need to stake some tokens. Think of this like putting down a deposit that shows you're serious about making a valuable contribution.

If your message gets approved by all co-authors, you become a co-author yourself. If it's not approved, the tokens go to those who decided against including your message. This helps ensure people think carefully about what they contribute.

## Getting Started

1. Connect your wallet
2. Browse existing threads
3. Start contributing to discussions
4. Earn co-authorship through quality content
5. Help curate future contributions

## Practical Benefits

- You own your contributions
- Quality content is rewarded
- Spam and noise are minimized
- Collaborative discussions evolve naturally
- Value accumulates in successful threads

## Simple Guidelines

- Write thoughtful messages
- Consider the thread's context
- Respect co-author decisions
- Contribute meaningfully
- Build relationships through collaboration

The beauty of Choir is that while these mechanics are simple to understand, they create space for sophisticated collaboration and value creation. You don't need to understand all the deeper implications to start participating and benefiting from the platform.
