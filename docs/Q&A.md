# Choir Project Questions and Discussion Points

After reviewing the updated project documentation and recent clarifications, the following questions and areas for discussion have been addressed:

---

## 1. Thread Ownership and Co-authorship

- **Question**: How does the concept of "co-authors" align with the initial thread creator?
- **Answer**: The initial thread creator is the first co-author. Every message is owned by its creator, and threads are owned by the creators of the messages within them. This simplifies the ownership model and aligns with the collaborative nature of the platform.

---

## 2. Message Approval Process

- **Question**: How does the "spec" (speculative response) mechanism work in relation to the existing approval process?
- **Answer**: The "spec" mechanism replaces the existing approval process on a 1-to-1 basis. This streamlines the contribution process while maintaining the quality control aspect of the platform.

## 3. Co-author Limitations

- **Question**: Are there any limitations on the number of co-authors a thread can have?
- **Answer**: There are no limitations on the number of co-authors a thread can have. This allows for organic growth of collaborative discussions.

---

## 4. Token Distribution

- **Question**: How are token rewards distributed when a new message is approved or when their thread is cited?
- **Answer**: When a new message is approved, the tokens go to the THREAD, not individual messages. Threads have Solana accounts which store CHOIR tokens. This approach treats threads as entities that manifest connections between people.

- When a new message is denied:
  - Deniers split the tokens bid
  - Any approvers get nothing
  - Remaining tokens go to the Choir Treasury

## 5. Co-authorship Management

- **Question**: Is there a mechanism for removing co-authorship or transferring ownership of threads?
- **Answer**: Users can leave a thread at any time through divestment, taking a (1 / n - 1) share of the CHOIR tokens in the thread. Post-MVP, other mechanisms will be explored. The system is designed to establish trust naturally, as users have an incentive to reject low-quality responses.

---

## 6. AI-Generated Summaries

- **Question**: How does the AI-generated summary feature ensure privacy and accuracy?
- **Answer**: The AI-generated summaries will improve over time. They are not intended as a strong privacy wall but rather as a teaser to stimulate discourse. By compressing content to tweet-length, they create demand and encourage engagement with the full thread.

---

## 7. Reputation System

- **Question**: Are there any plans to implement a reputation system based on user contributions and co-authorship?
- **Answer**: No, there are currently no plans to implement a reputation system. The focus is on the quality of contributions and collaborative dynamics within threads.

---

## Future Considerations

- Post-MVP, threads could potentially hold SOL, stablecoins, or DeFi assets.
- AI-enabled group chats may manage these assets in the future.
- Further mechanisms for thread management and token distribution may be explored as the platform evolves.

---

These clarifications provide a clearer picture of Choir's ownership model, token distribution, and future directions. The focus on simplicity in ownership, combined with the innovative use of threads as token-holding entities, sets a foundation for a unique and engaging collaborative platform.
