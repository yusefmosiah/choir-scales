SEQUENCE approval_collapse:
  1. Spec enters superposition
  2. Co-authors entangle with state
  3. Approval votes create measurement
  4. Unanimous consent collapses state
  5. Value crystallizes in thread

## Value Flow Topology

TYPE ValueManifold = {
  potential: ScalarField,
  flow: VectorField,
  curvature: MetricTensor,
  singularities: Set Point
}

FUNCTION trace_value_flow(start: Point, end: Point) -> Geodesic:

    find_minimal_path
    verify_continuity

## Quantum Game Dynamics

  2. Value field shapes possibilities
  3. Observation collapses choices
  4. Payoffs crystallize
  5. New strategies emerge

## Integration Properties

PROPERTY semantic_game_duality:
  FORALL thread IN ThreadSpace:
    optimal_strategy(thread) IMPLIES
      minimal_semantic_distance(thread) AND
      maximal_value_flow(thread)

PROPERTY measurement_topology:
  FORALL obs IN Observations:
    measurement_collapse(obs) IMPLIES
      continuous_value_transfer(obs) AND
      preserved_fiber_structure(obs)

Through this integration we see how:
- Semantic fields shape strategic spaces
- Game mechanics drive field evolution
- Topology preserves essential structure
- Measurement bridges quantum and classical
