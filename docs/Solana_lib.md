## Core Program Structure

The Choir program implements thread ownership, message approval, and token mechanics through a set of carefully designed state transitions and security invariants.

## Thread Initialization

TYPE InitializeThread = {
  creator: Signer,
  thread: Account<Thread>,
  system_program: Program<System>,
  token_program: Program<Token>
}

SEQUENCE initialize_thread:
  1. Parameter Validation
     - thread_id.len() <= 32
     - thread_id is unique
     - PDA derivation is valid

  2. State Initialization
     - timestamps = (now(), now())
     - co_authors = [creator]
     - token_balance = 0
     - messages = []
     - pending_specs = []

  3. State Verification
     - all fields initialized
     - co_author present
     - timestamps valid

PROPERTY post_initialization:
  thread.co_authors.len() == 1 AND
  thread.token_balance == 0 AND
  thread.messages.is_empty()

## Message Submission

TYPE SubmitMessage = {
  author: Signer,
  thread: Account<Thread>,
  token_program: Program<Token>
}

SEQUENCE submit_message:
  1. Authorization
     - author in thread.co_authors
     - thread not full
     - valid content hash

  2. Message Creation
     - struct with content hash
     - current timestamp
     - empty approvals

  3. Thread Update
     - append message
     - increment count
     - update timestamp

PROPERTY post_submission:
  thread.message_count == old_count + 1 AND
  thread.messages.last().author == author.key()

## Approval Processing

TYPE ProcessApproval = {
  co_author: Signer,
  thread: Account<Thread>
}

SEQUENCE process_approval:
  1. Authority Check
     - co_author in thread.co_authors
     - no duplicate votes
     - valid message/spec index

  2. Approval Recording
     - create approval record
     - add to approval set
     - update timestamp

  3. Consensus Check
     - count approvals
     - check against co_author count
     - process if complete

PROPERTY post_approval:
  message.approvals.contains(co_author) AND
  thread.updated_at > old_updated_at

## Value Flow Properties

TYPE ValueTransition =
  | Approve: stake -> thread
  | Deny: stake -> deniers
  | Mixed: excess -> treasury

PROPERTY value_conservation:
  FORALL transition IN ValueTransition:
    sum(input_tokens) == sum(output_tokens)

## Security Properties

1. **Thread Integrity**   ```
   PROPERTY thread_integrity:
     FORALL thread IN threads:
       thread.co_authors.non_empty() AND
       thread.messages.all_valid() AND
       thread.token_balance >= 0   ```

2. **Approval Integrity**   ```
   PROPERTY approval_integrity:
     FORALL approval IN approvals:
       approval.co_author IN thread.co_authors AND
       approval.timestamp <= now() AND
       no_duplicates(thread.approvals)   ```

3. **State Transitions**   ```
   PROPERTY state_transition:
     FORALL old_state new_state:
       valid_transition(old_state, new_state) AND
       preserves_invariants(new_state) AND
       maintains_history(old_state, new_state)   ```

## Error Handling

TYPE ChoirError =
  | NotCoAuthor
  | InsufficientStake
  | InvalidApproval
  | ThreadOperationFailed
  | TokenOperationFailed

FUNCTION handle_error(error: ChoirError) -> Result<()>:
  log_error(error)
  revert_state()
  emit_event(error)
  RETURN Err(error)

## Implementation Notes

The program maintains several critical invariants:

1. Thread Ownership
   - Co-author set is never empty
   - Only co-authors can approve messages
   - PDA derivation ensures unique threads

2. Token Conservation
   - All token movements are atomic
   - Stakes are properly tracked
   - Distribution preserves total supply

3. State Consistency
   - All updates are atomic
   - Timestamps always increase
   - Message ordering preserved

Through these mechanisms, the program provides a secure foundation for collaborative content creation and value distribution.
