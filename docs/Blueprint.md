# Blueprint for Choir MVP Launch

**Date:** October 11, 2024

---

## Overview

This blueprint outlines an accelerated plan to develop and launch the **Choir** platform's Minimum Viable Product (MVP) by **October 17, 2024**. By leveraging advanced AI capabilities, the development timeline is condensed into a one-week sprint. The MVP will integrate blockchain-based tokenomics, a collaborative Authors Chat system, and an AI-driven content creation and curation model.

Post-launch plans include introducing a monthly membership plan, supporting multimedia content (images, audio, video, version-controlled code), and developing a SwiftUI frontend with an integrated Solana wallet for Apple platforms.
