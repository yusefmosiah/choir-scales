# Choir Project Blueprint (30-Day MVP Focus)

## Overview

This blueprint outlines the key components and architecture for the Choir MVP, to be developed and launched within a 30-day timeframe.

## Core Components (MVP)

1. **Chat-Based Interface**
   - Real-time messaging system
   - Thread-based conversations
   - Simplified message ownership and co-authorship model

2. **Tokenomics (Mock CHOIR Token)**
   - Simplified token system for MVP
   - Basic staking and reward mechanisms

3. **Collaborative Approval Mechanism**
   - Simplified speculative response ("spec") submission
   - Basic co-author approval process

4. **AI-Generated Summaries**
   - Basic summaries for non-co-authors

5. **Solana Integration**
   - Basic wallet connectivity
   - Simplified token transactions (potentially mocked)

6. **Vector Database (Qdrant)**
   - Basic integration for chat message storage

7. **Chorus Loop**
   - Implementation of all steps (AEIOU(Y))
   - Focus on essential functionality

## MVP Architecture

### Frontend
- Next.js-based web application
