# Choir Project Blueprint

## Overview

Choir is a decentralized, chat-based platform that aims to create the world's highest signal human dataset through collaborative discussions and innovative tokenomics. This blueprint outlines the key components, architecture, and development roadmap for the Choir project.

## Core Components

1. **Chat-Based Interface**
   - Real-time messaging system
   - Thread-based conversations
   - Message ownership and co-authorship model

2. **Tokenomics (CHOIR Token)**
   - Solana-based token
   - Used for staking, rewards, and governance
   - Total supply: 10 billion CHOIR tokens

3. **Collaborative Approval Mechanism**
   - Speculative response ("spec") submission
   - Co-author approval process
   - Token distribution based on approvals/denials

4. **AI-Generated Summaries**
   - Compressed thread summaries for non-co-authors
   - Designed to stimulate engagement and interest

5. **Solana Integration**
   - Wallet connectivity
   - Smart contracts for token transactions and thread ownership
   - Thread token storage in Solana accounts

6. **Vector Database (Qdrant)**
   - Storage and retrieval of chat messages
   - Efficient similarity search for AI training

7. **AI Model Development**
   - Training on curated, token-scored dataset
   - Focus on qualitative, stylistic, and artistic improvements

## Architecture

### Frontend
- Next.js-based web application
- React components for UI elements
- Web3 integration for Solana wallet connectivity

### Backend
- FastAPI (Python) for API endpoints
- WebSocket support for real-time chat
- Integration with Qdrant for vector storage

### Blockchain Layer
- Solana blockchain for token transactions and storage
- Custom smart contracts for thread token management

### AI Layer
- Azure OpenAI for embeddings and completions
- Custom AI model development (target: April 2025)

## Development Roadmap

### Phase 1: MVP Development (Current)
- Implement core chat functionality with ownership model
- Integrate Solana wallet and basic token mechanics
- Develop and test collaborative approval system for messages and specs
- Implement AI-generated summaries for non-co-authors

### Phase 2: Enhanced Features (Q4 2023 - Q2 2024)
- Refine tokenomics and implement advanced token distribution
- Develop and deploy Solana smart contracts for thread ownership and token management
- Implement email notification system for co-authors
- Integrate Thirdweb Embedded Wallet
- Develop speculative response ("spec") submission and approval process

### Phase 3: AI Model Development (Q3 2024 - Q2 2025)
- Collect and curate token-scored dataset
- Develop and train custom AI model
- Implement AI model integration with the platform

### Phase 4: Platform Expansion (Q3 2025 onwards)
- Implement governance features
- Explore additional use cases for the CHOIR token
- Continuous improvement of AI capabilities

## Key Challenges and Solutions

1. **User Onboarding**
   - Develop intuitive UI/UX
   - Create comprehensive documentation and tutorials

2. **Co-author Coordination**
   - Implement efficient notification systems
   - Develop tools for co-author communication

3. **Scalability**
   - Optimize database queries and caching
   - Implement load balancing and horizontal scaling

4. **Security**
   - Regular security audits
   - Implement best practices for smart contract development

5. **AI Model Quality**
   - Continuous refinement of the dataset
   - Iterative model training and evaluation

6. **Co-authorship Management**
   - Develop efficient systems for tracking and updating co-authorship status
   - Implement secure divestment processes for co-authors

## Conclusion

This blueprint provides a high-level overview of the Choir project's structure and development plan. As the project evolves, this document will be updated to reflect new insights, challenges, and solutions.
