## Core Vision

Choir envisions a world where quality communication creates lasting value. Like voices joining in song, we enable collaborative spaces where ideas harmonize, evolve, and create something greater than the sum of their parts.

## Foundation

At its heart, Choir is a communication platform with an unusual property: contributions require unanimous approval from thread co-authors. This simple rule creates profound effects:

- Quality emerges from harmony
- Value accrues to contributors
- Collaboration becomes ownership
- Ideas evolve into assets

## Growth Pattern

Threads in Choir aren't just containers for messages - they're living spaces that can evolve in unexpected ways. Like musical themes that might become symphonies, threads contain potential that unfolds through synchrony and resonance.

## Voice-First Future

While beginning with text, Choir's natural form is voice - enabling participation while walking, driving, or simply living life. AI helps transform these communications into:
- Dynamic audio experiences
- Rich multimedia expression
- Generative radio and video
- The rhythm of daily life

## AI Integration

AI serves not as a replacement but as an amplifier of human communication. Like an instrument augmenting voice, it helps surface patterns, bridge perspectives, and accelerate understanding. The AI doesn't lead - it accompanies and harmonizes with the human journey of discovery.

## Token Mechanics

The CHOIR token isn't just a currency - it's a tool for capturing and distributing value created through authentic communication. As threads mature, tokens naturally flow to those who contribute to the harmony.

## Network Effects

Each resonant thread strengthens the network. Quality attracts quality. Harmony creates harmony. The system naturally evolves toward higher forms of synchrony and more sophisticated composition.

## Future Horizons

We don't prescribe where threads might lead - we provide the conditions for organic growth. Some threads might remain pure communication. Others might evolve into songs, dances, projects, or entirely new forms of human coordination.

The beauty is in the emergence - in letting natural human communication, augmented by AI and incentivized by tokens, create new possibilities for harmony and collective creation.
