## Core Vision

Choir envisions a world where quality conversations create lasting value. By combining human insight with AI capabilities, we enable collaborative spaces where good ideas can grow and evolve naturally.

## Foundation

At its heart, Choir is a chat platform with an unusual property: messages require unanimous approval from thread co-authors. This simple rule creates profound effects:

- Quality emerges from consensus
- Value accrues to contributors
- Collaboration becomes ownership
- Ideas evolve into assets

## Growth Pattern

Threads in Choir aren't just containers for messages - they're living spaces that can evolve in unexpected ways. Like seeds that might become flowers or trees, threads contain potential that unfolds based on their participants and environment.

## AI Integration

AI serves not as a replacement but as an amplifier of human capability. It helps surface patterns, bridge perspectives, and accelerate understanding. The AI doesn't lead - it accompanies and augments the human journey of discovery.

## Token Mechanics

The CHOIR token isn't just a currency - it's a tool for capturing and distributing value created through collaboration. As threads mature, tokens naturally flow to those who contribute to quality outcomes.

## Network Effects

Each successful thread strengthens the network. Quality attracts quality. Value creates value. The system naturally evolves toward higher forms of collaboration and more sophisticated value creation.

## Future Horizons

We don't prescribe where threads might lead - we provide the conditions for organic growth. Some threads might remain pure conversation. Others might evolve in ways we haven't imagined.

The beauty is in the emergence.
