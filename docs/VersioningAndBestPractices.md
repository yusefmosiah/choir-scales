# Choir: Versioning and Best Practices Guide

## Core Dependencies and Versions

[dependencies]
anchor-lang = "0.29.0"
anchor-spl = "0.29.0"
solana-program = "1.17"
spl-token = "4.0"
spl-associated-token-account = "2.2"

## Guiding Principles

1. **Correctness First**
   - All state transitions must be valid and verified
   - Full account validation using Anchor constraints
   - Comprehensive error handling
   - Explicit security checks

2. **Code Clarity**
   - Self-documenting code structure
   - Clear naming conventions
   - Explicit rather than implicit behavior
   - Comprehensive documentation

3. **Maintainability**
   - Modular design
   - Single responsibility principle
   - Clear upgrade paths
   - Thorough testing

4. **Performance** (only after above are satisfied)
   - Space-efficient account structures
   - Optimized transaction flow
   - Batched operations where sensible

## Security Requirements

1. Account Validation
   - Owner checks on all accounts
   - Signer verification for all state changes
   - PDA seed validation
   - Rent/balance verification

2. Access Control
   - Thread ownership verification
   - Co-author status validation
   - Operation-specific authorization
   - Explicit permission checks

3. State Management
   - Atomic operations
   - No partial state updates
   - Validated state transitions
   - Protected critical operations

## Development Standards

1. Code Organization
   - Modular file structure
   - Clear separation of concerns
   - Consistent naming conventions
   - Comprehensive documentation

2. Testing Requirements
   - Unit tests for all functions
   - Integration tests for workflows
   - Security-focused test cases
   - Local validator testing

3. Error Handling
   - Custom error enum
   - Descriptive error messages
   - Proper error propagation
   - Recovery procedures

## Account Structure Guidelines

1. Space Management
   - Fixed account sizes
   - Explicit space calculations
   - Buffer for future expansion
   - Documentation of space usage

2. PDA Design
   - Meaningful seed structure
   - Documented seed patterns
   - Collision prevention
   - Clear derivation logic

## Transaction Flow

1. Instruction Design
   - Atomic operations
   - Clear preconditions
   - Explicit validation
   - Documented side effects

2. State Transitions
   - Single responsibility
   - Atomic updates
   - Validated inputs
   - Clear success criteria

## Deployment and Upgrades

1. Deployment Process
   - Security review
   - Test environment validation
   - Staged rollout
   - Monitoring plan

2. Upgrade Strategy
   - State migration plan
   - Backward compatibility
   - Rollback procedures
   - Communication plan

## Version Control

1. Branch Strategy
   - main: production code
   - develop: integration branch
   - feature/*: feature development
   - release/*: release preparation

2. Release Process
   - Version tagging
   - Changelog maintenance
   - Security review
   - Deployment validation

## Monitoring and Maintenance

1. Runtime Monitoring
   - Transaction success rate
   - Error frequency
   - Performance metrics
   - Resource utilization

2. Security Monitoring
   - Dependency audits
   - Vulnerability scanning
   - Access pattern analysis
   - Incident response

## Documentation Requirements

1. Code Documentation
   - Function documentation
   - State transitions
   - Security considerations
   - Error conditions

2. Operational Documentation
   - Deployment procedures
   - Monitoring guidelines
   - Incident response
   - Upgrade procedures

## Version History
