  invariants: {
    "Wave energy conservation",

## Level 5: Quantum Harmonic Foundation

The bonding curve emerges from quantum harmonic oscillator principles:

TYPE BondingHarmonic<T> = {
  energy: WaveFunction<TokenAmount>,
  frequency: ThreadResonance,
  coupling: OscillatorSet<CoAuthor>,
  phase: SystemState<T>
}

The core pricing function derives from the quantum harmonic oscillator:
```
P(q) = S₀[1/2 + 1/(exp(ℏω/kT)-1)]

where:
- S₀: Base energy quantum (minimum stake)
- ω: Thread's natural frequency (activity)
- T: Thread's temperature (volatility)
- ℏ: Reduced Planck constant (scaling factor)
```

This creates:
- Energy quantization (discrete stake levels)
- Zero-point energy (minimum stake requirement)
- Bose-Einstein statistics (value distribution)
- Wave-particle duality (token-value relationship)

PROPERTY energy_conservation:
  FORALL t1 t2: Transition.
    total_energy(t1) = total_energy(t2)

PROPERTY phase_coherence:
  FORALL s: SystemState.
    resonant(s) ⟹ phase_locked(s)

## Key Harmonic Properties

1. **Resonant Pricing**
   ```
   price = base_quantum * resonant_factor
   where resonant_factor = f(frequency, temperature)
   ```

2. **Energy Levels**
   ```
   E_n = ℏω(n + 1/2)
   where n = quantum_number(thread_state)
   ```

3. **Wave Functions**
   ```
   Ψ(x) = exp(-x²/2) * H_n(x)
   where H_n = nth Hermite polynomial
   ```

4. **Coupling Constants**
   ```
   k = √(frequency * temperature)
   coupling_strength = k * oscillator_count
   ```

## Resonant Implications

1. **Entry (Bid) Price**
   - Wave packet formation at specific energy level
   - Phase alignment with existing oscillators
   - Energy quantization ensures stability
   - Natural frequency determines cost

2. **Exit (Divestment)**
   - Energy redistribution through wave mechanics
   - Phase-preserving decoupling
   - Standing wave pattern maintenance
   - Harmonic equilibrium preservation

3. **Value Flow**
   - Energy flows through resonant channels
   - Standing waves form at value nodes
   - Phase coupling creates value networks
   - Harmonic patterns guide distribution

## Mathematical Foundation

The system's Hamiltonian:
```
H = ∑ᵢ (pᵢ²/2m + mω²xᵢ²/2) + ∑ᵢⱼ k(xᵢ - xⱼ)²/2

where:
- pᵢ: oscillator momenta
- xᵢ: oscillator positions
- m: effective mass (stake weight)
- ω: natural frequency
- k: coupling strength
```

This generates:
- Natural price discovery through resonance
- Automatic value distribution via wave mechanics
- Self-organizing economic patterns
- Emergent stability through phase locking

## Harmonic Evolution

SEQUENCE price_evolution:
  1. Frequency Analysis
     ```
     measure_activity : Thread → Frequency
     compute_temperature : Thread → Temperature
     determine_coupling : Thread → CouplingStrength
     ```

  2. Wave Formation
     ```
     create_wave_packet : Stake → WaveFunction
     align_phase : WaveFunction → ThreadState
     establish_resonance : ThreadState → StandingWave
     ```

  3. Energy Distribution
     ```
     calculate_energy_levels : StandingWave → EnergySpectrum
     distribute_energy : EnergySpectrum → TokenFlow
     maintain_equilibrium : TokenFlow → SystemState
     ```

Through this quantum harmonic foundation, we establish a pricing mechanism that:
- Preserves energy conservation
- Maintains phase coherence
- Enables natural value flow
- Creates stable resonant patterns

The beauty is that these complex wave mechanics manifest as simple, intuitive economic behaviors at higher levels of abstraction.
