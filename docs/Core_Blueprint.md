## Architecture Overview

ASSUMPTION tech_stack:
  "Solana + Next.js + FastAPI + Qdrant"
  "May introduce additional components"
  "Must maintain clear boundaries"

ASSUMPTION scaling_strategy:
  "Component-level scaling"
  "May introduce additional infrastructure"
  "Must maintain performance guarantees"

## Core Components

1. **Chat-Based Interface**
   - Real-time messaging system
   - Thread-based conversations
   - Message ownership and co-authorship model

2. **Tokenomics (CHOIR Token)**
   - Solana-based token
   - Used for staking, rewards, and governance
   - Total supply: 10 billion CHOIR tokens

3. **Collaborative Approval Mechanism**
   - Speculative response ("spec") submission
   - Co-author approval process
   - Token distribution based on approvals/denials

4. **AI-Generated Summaries**
   - Compressed thread summaries for non-co-authors
   - Designed to stimulate engagement and interest

5. **Solana Integration**
   - Wallet connectivity
   - Smart contracts for token transactions and thread ownership
   - Thread token storage in Solana accounts

6. **Vector Database (Qdrant)**
   - Storage and retrieval of chat messages
   - Efficient similarity search for AI training

7. **AI Model Development**
   - Training on curated, token-scored dataset
   - Focus on qualitative, stylistic, and artistic improvements

## Architecture

### Frontend
- Next.js-based web application
- React components for UI elements
- Web3 integration for Solana wallet connectivity

### Backend
- FastAPI (Python) for API endpoints
- WebSocket support for real-time chat
- Integration with Qdrant for vector storage

### Blockchain Layer
- Solana blockchain for token transactions and storage
- Custom smart contracts for thread token management

### AI Layer
- Azure OpenAI for embeddings and completions
- Custom AI model development (target: April 2025)

## Development Roadmap

### Phase 1: MVP Development (Current)
- Infrastructure setup and Solana program development (Oct 23-24)
- Backend and frontend implementation (Oct 25-26)
- Testing and soft launch (Oct 27)
- System improvements and refinement (Oct 28-30)
- Public launch (Oct 31)

### Phase 2: Enhanced Features (Q4 2023 - Q2 2024)
- Launch Swift (iOS and beyond), Android, Solana Mobile
- Refine tokenomics and implement advanced token distribution
- Implement email notification system for co-authors
- Enhance wallet integration features
- Develop speculative response ("spec") submission and approval process

### Phase 3: AI Model Development (Q3 2024 - April 2025)
- Collect and curate token-scored dataset
- Develop and train custom AI model
- Implement AI model integration with the platform

### Phase 4: Platform Expansion (Q3 2025 onwards)
- Implement governance features
- Explore additional use cases for the CHOIR token
- Continuous improvement of AI capabilities

## Key Challenges and Solutions

1. **User Onboarding**
   - Develop intuitive UI/UX
   - Create comprehensive documentation and tutorials

2. **Co-author Coordination**
   - Implement efficient notification systems
   - Develop tools for co-author communication

3. **Scalability**
   - Optimize database queries and caching
   - Implement load balancing and horizontal scaling

4. **Security**
   - Regular security audits
   - Implement best practices for smart contract development

5. **AI Model Quality**
   - Continuous refinement of the dataset
   - Iterative model training and evaluation

6. **Co-authorship Management**
   - Develop efficient systems for tracking and updating co-authorship status
   - Implement secure divestment processes for co-authors

## Conclusion
