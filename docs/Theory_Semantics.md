## Semantic Foundations

The thread model mirrors the quantum nature of language itself. Just as words exist in superposition of meanings until context collapses them to specific interpretations, threads exist in superposition of potential value states until participant interactions collapse them to specific forms.

## Value Entanglement

Thread participants become semantically entangled through their shared context. The stake mechanism isn't just economic - it's a manifestation of how meaning requires commitment to context. Non-refundable bids are natural because semantic engagement cannot be uncommitted.

## Compositional Dynamics

Just as quantum linguistics shows how meaning composes through tensor products, thread value composes through:
- Participant relationships
- Context accumulation
- Semantic density
- Value crystallization

## Measurement Effects

The act of observing (participating in) a thread affects its evolution, similar to quantum measurement. AI summaries and search functions become semantic measurement operators that influence thread trajectories.

## Coherence Preservation

Thread integrity is maintained through:
- Semantic consistency
- Value conservation
- Context preservation
- Relationship coherence

These mirror the coherence properties of quantum systems.

## Emergence Operators

Certain patterns act as operators on thread state:
- Quality consensus creates semantic collapse
- Token flows measure value gradients
- Co-authorship entangles participants
- AI interaction superimposes contexts

Through this lens, Choir becomes not just a platform but a manifestation of fundamental properties of meaning and value creation.
