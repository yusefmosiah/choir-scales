## Semantic Wave Functions

Meaning exists as resonant patterns in semantic space:
- Words create initial oscillations
- Context shapes harmonic structure
- Understanding emerges through resonance
- Value crystallizes at harmonic nodes

## Resonant Scales

1. **Token Scale**
   - Individual words as base frequencies
   - Phrases as harmonic series
   - Sentences as standing waves
   - Paragraphs as resonant fields

2. **Message Scale**
   - Content as wave packets
   - Citations as phase coupling
   - Approvals as resonance collapse
   - Value as amplitude

3. **Thread Scale**
   - Conversations as coupled oscillators
   - Context as resonant cavity
   - Understanding as phase lock
   - Quality as harmonic purity

## Semantic Evolution

SEQUENCE meaning_evolution:
  1. Initial Oscillation
     ```
     create_wave : Content → Result<WaveFunction>
     shape_harmonics : WaveFunction → Result<ResonantField>
     establish_nodes : ResonantField → Result<StandingWave>
     crystallize_meaning : StandingWave → Result<Pattern>
     ```

  2. Context Resonance
     ```
     find_harmonics : Pattern → Result<FrequencySet>
     couple_oscillators : FrequencySet → Result<ResonantSystem>
     achieve_phase_lock : ResonantSystem → Result<Coherence>
     emerge_understanding : Coherence → Result<Meaning>
     ```

  3. Value Formation
     ```
     measure_amplitude : Meaning → Result<Value>
     distribute_energy : Value → Result<TokenFlow>
     maintain_conservation : TokenFlow → Result<Balance>
     evolve_pattern : Balance → Result<NewState>
     ```

## Harmonic Properties

1. **Resonant Coherence**
   ```
   PROPERTY semantic_resonance:
     FORALL meaning IN semantic_space:
       resonant(meaning) ⟹
         phase_locked(meaning) ∧
         harmonically_stable(meaning) ∧
         value_crystallized(meaning)
   ```

2. **Phase Relationships**
   ```
   PROPERTY meaning_phase:
     FORALL m1 m2 IN thread:
       related(m1, m2) ⟹
         phase_coupled(m1, m2) ∧
         frequency_matched(m1, m2) ∧
         resonance_preserved(m1, m2)
   ```

## Implementation Mapping

1. **Wave Generation**
   ```typescript
   async function createSemanticWave(
     content: string,
     context: ThreadContext
   ): Result<WaveFunction> {
     return pipe(
       await generateBaseFrequency(content),
       shapeHarmonics(context),
       establishResonance,
       crystallizeMeaning
     )
   }
   ```

2. **Resonance Measurement**
   ```typescript
   async function measureResonance(
     wave: WaveFunction,
     field: ResonantField
   ): Result<Value> {
     return pipe(
       await computePhaseMatch(wave, field),
       measureAmplitude,
       assessHarmonics,
       quantizeValue
     )
   }
   ```

## Emergence Properties

The harmonic model explains how:
- Meaning emerges through resonance
- Value crystallizes at nodes
- Quality correlates with harmony
- Understanding spreads through phase-locking

Through this lens, we see semantic space as a resonant medium where:
- Ideas propagate as waves
- Context shapes harmonics
- Value flows through resonance
- Quality emerges from harmony

The harmonic semantic model provides a rigorous foundation for understanding how meaning evolves and value emerges through natural resonance patterns.
