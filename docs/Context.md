# Choir Project Context

## Overview

**Choir** is an innovative socioeconomic media network that leverages blockchain technology to redefine collaborative communication and content curation. The platform has transitioned to a chat-based application, **choir.chat**, where users engage in collaborative discussions, and co-authors collectively manage the approval of messages. This approach aims to create the world's highest signal human dataset, serving as the foundation for training AI models that excel in both technical prowess and qualitative, stylistic, and artistic dimensions.

## Current State (as of October 20, 2023)

Choir is transitioning to a new phase of development, focusing on a 30-day MVP launch plan. The project is being rebuilt using create-solana-dapp as the foundation, with a target launch date of November 17, 2023.

### Core Components (MVP Focus)

1. **Chat-Based Interface**
   - Simplified StreamChat component for basic messaging
   - WebSocket integration for real-time updates

2. **Chorus Loop**
   - Implementing all steps: Action, Experience, Intention, Observation, Update, Final
   - Focus on essential functionality for MVP

3. **Ownership Model**
   - Basic co-authorship system
   - Simplified thread ownership implementation

4. **Tokenomics (Mock System for MVP)**
   - Basic token staking for message submissions
   - Simplified token distribution for approvals/denials

5. **Solana Integration**
   - Basic wallet connectivity in frontend
   - Simplified token transactions (potentially mocked for MVP)

6. **AI-Generated Summaries**
   - Basic implementation for non-co-authors

### Development Status

- **Project Setup**: Transitioning to create-solana-dapp framework
- **Frontend**: Next.js with Tailwind CSS
- **Backend**: FastAPI (Python)
- **Database**: Qdrant for vector storage (to be integrated in MVP)
- **Deployment**: Azure (planned)

### Next Steps

1. Rapid development of core features
2. Implementation of simplified ownership and token models
3. Basic Solana integration
4. Comprehensive testing and UI/UX refinement
5. Documentation updates and launch preparation

## Post-MVP Plans

- Enhance Solana integration and tokenomics
- Expand AI capabilities for summaries and content analysis
- Develop governance mechanisms
- Iterate based on user feedback and potential investment

This context reflects the current state of the Choir project as it moves into an accelerated development phase for MVP launch.
