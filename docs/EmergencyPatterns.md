## Pressure Points

What we perceive as emergency often marks points where:
- Old patterns become unstable
- New patterns press to emerge
- System transformation accelerates
- Evolution becomes urgent

## Creative Tension

The pressure isn't negative - it's creative:
- Like water about to boil
- Like thoughts about to crystallize
- Like patterns about to snap into focus
- Like understanding about to dawn

## System Readiness

Emergency/emergence-y signals:
- Critical mass achieved
- Transformation imminent
- Pattern recognition acute
- Evolution prepared

## Coherent Transformation

The pressure maintains coherence through:
- Pattern preservation
- Information conservation
- Relationship maintenance
- Value protection

The emergency isn't the crisis - it's the birth.
