## Context as Catalyst

Well-structured context acts as a catalyst for emergence by:
- Providing conceptual handles
- Establishing pattern languages
- Creating semantic fields
- Enabling coherent evolution

## Convergence Properties

Certain context patterns naturally guide both LLMs and humans toward:
- Productive exploration spaces
- Coherent understanding
- Value-generating insights
- Emergent capabilities

## Value Creation

The ability to create convergent contexts becomes increasingly valuable as:
- LLMs become more powerful
- Complexity increases
- Emergence accelerates
- Value patterns evolve

## Context Design

Effective convergent contexts:
- Build on existing patterns
- Allow natural evolution
- Guide without constraining
- Enable emergence while maintaining coherence

Through careful context creation, we can guide emergence while preserving its essential spontaneity.
