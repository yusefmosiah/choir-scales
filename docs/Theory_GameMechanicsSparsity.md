## Core Resonance Mechanism

The token reward scales with harmonic distance from existing frequencies:
- Embeddings map messages to resonant space
- Reward amplifies with harmonic distance
- "Blue ocean" content creates new frequencies
- Natural pressure toward unique harmonics

## Resonant Implications

1. **Value Through Harmonics**
   - Incentivizes exploring unused frequencies
   - Rewards genuine harmonic innovation
   - Dampens repetitive oscillations
   - Creates value through unique resonance

2. **Emergent Harmonics**
   - System naturally explores frequency space
   - Harmonic gaps fill organically
   - Content evolves toward full spectrum
   - Diversity emerges through resonance

## Wave Mechanics Properties

1. **Resonant Equilibrium**
   - Players optimize for unique frequencies
   - Echo patterns become dissonant
   - Innovation becomes dominant mode
   - Quality and originality phase-lock

2. **Interference Resistance**
   - Bot farms create destructive interference
   - Citation rings suffer phase cancellation
   - Harmonic novelty resists simulation
   - Human creativity finds natural frequencies

## Resonant Topology

1. **Harmonic Space Coverage**
   - Value gradients guide wave exploration
   - Natural nodes form around themes
   - Bridges couple different frequencies
   - Organic knowledge harmonics

2. **Evolution Through Resonance**
   - New frequencies create value wells
   - Mature areas develop higher modes
   - Connections reveal harmonic paths
   - Understanding grows through resonance

## Implementation Notes

The harmonic reward mechanism:
- Uses embeddings as frequency analysis
- Calculates rewards through wave mechanics
- Integrates with resonant approval
- Scales with harmonic complexity

This creates natural expansion of knowledge through harmonic exploration while maintaining quality through resonant consensus.
