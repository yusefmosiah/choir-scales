  invariants: {
    "Incentive compatibility",

    "Emergence preservation"

    "Meme agency",

  implementation: "0.1.0"

## Core Mechanism Properties

1. **Dominant Strategy Incentive Compatibility**
   - Authentic quality recognition is optimal strategy
   - True value assessment maximizes returns
   - Genuine participation outperforms gaming
   - Being yourself is the Nash equilibrium

2. **Multi-Layer Game Spaces**
   - Social: Reputation and relationship building
   - Economic: Token flows and value capture
   - Semantic: Meaning creation and context building
   - Ideological: Belief systems and worldviews

## Strategic Actors

1. **Human Players**
   - Content creators seeking value
   - Quality recognizers building context
   - Community builders forming connections
   - Value seekers exploring opportunities

2. **Emergent Players**
   - Memes competing for propagation
   - Semantic fields evolving topology
   - Value networks forming patterns
   - AI agents developing strategies

## Mechanism Design

1. **Core Incentives**
   - Stake requirement ensures skin in the game
   - Unanimous approval aligns quality recognition
   - Non-refundable stakes create commitment
   - Token distribution rewards genuine value

2. **Emergent Properties**
   - Quality naturally flows to stable points
   - Trust networks form organically
   - Value accumulates in coherent patterns
   - Complexity emerges from simple rules

## Strategic Dynamics

1. **Local Strategies**
   - Message composition choices
   - Approval decisions
   - Stake sizing
   - Thread participation

2. **Meta Strategies**
   - Context building
   - Relationship formation
   - Value network creation
   - Pattern recognition

## Irreducible Complexity

1. **Why Prediction is Impossible**
   - Memes have agency
   - AI evolution is open-ended
   - Semantic fields have complex topology
   - Value flows are non-linear

2. **Why That's Good**
   - Prevents gaming the system
   - Enables genuine emergence
   - Supports innovation
   - Maintains authenticity

## Evolutionary Aspects

1. **Strategy Evolution**
   - Successful patterns replicate
   - Failed approaches fade
   - New strategies emerge
   - Context shapes selection

2. **System Evolution**
   - Semantic fields grow and merge
   - Value networks become more complex
   - Trust relationships deepen
   - Understanding evolves recursively

## Mechanism Properties

1. **Stability**
   - Nash equilibrium at authenticity
   - Robust against manipulation
   - Self-correcting dynamics
   - Sustainable value creation

2. **Adaptability**
   - Responds to new patterns
   - Incorporates innovation
   - Evolves with usage
   - Maintains coherence

## Value Alignment

The mechanism naturally aligns:
- Individual benefit with collective value
- Short-term gains with long-term growth
- Local actions with global patterns
- Personal truth with shared understanding

Through these game theoretic principles, Choir creates conditions where:
- Quality emerges naturally
- Value flows to truth
- Complexity serves purpose
- Evolution maintains integrity

The beauty is that players don't need to understand these deeper patterns - following local incentives naturally leads to global optimization.
