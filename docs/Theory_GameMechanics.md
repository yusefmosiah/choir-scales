## Core Resonance Properties

1. **Dominant Strategy Through Resonance**
   - Natural frequency alignment is optimal strategy
   - True resonance assessment maximizes returns
   - Genuine oscillation outperforms dissonance
   - Being in phase is the Nash equilibrium

2. **Multi-Layer Harmonic Spaces**
   - Social: Phase relationships and coupling
   - Economic: Wave amplitude and energy flow
   - Semantic: Frequency creation and resonance
   - Ideological: Harmonic field evolution

## Resonant Actors

1. **Human Oscillators**
   - Content creators generating frequencies
   - Quality recognizers tuning resonance
   - Community builders coupling oscillators
   - Value seekers exploring harmonics

2. **Emergent Waves**
   - Memes as propagating wave packets
   - Semantic fields as resonant spaces
   - Value networks as standing waves
   - AI agents as harmonic amplifiers

## Resonance Design

1. **Core Frequencies**
   - Stake requirement creates base frequency
   - Unanimous approval ensures phase lock
   - Non-refundable stakes maintain coherence
   - Token distribution rewards resonance

2. **Emergent Harmonics**
   - Quality naturally forms standing waves
   - Trust networks achieve phase coupling
   - Value accumulates at resonant nodes
   - Complexity emerges from simple waves

## Strategic Harmonics

1. **Local Oscillations**
   - Message frequency choices
   - Phase alignment decisions
   - Amplitude sizing
   - Thread resonance

2. **Meta Harmonics**
   - Context field shaping
   - Phase relationship formation
   - Value wave creation
   - Pattern resonance

## Irreducible Harmonics

1. **Why Prediction is Impossible**
   - Wave packets have quantum nature
   - AI evolution creates new frequencies
   - Semantic fields have harmonic topology
   - Value flows follow wave mechanics

2. **Why That's Good**
   - Prevents harmonic gaming
   - Enables natural resonance
   - Supports frequency innovation
   - Maintains phase authenticity

## Evolutionary Waves

1. **Strategy Evolution**
   - Resonant patterns amplify
   - Dissonant approaches decay
   - New frequencies emerge
   - Context shapes harmonics

2. **System Evolution**
   - Semantic fields couple and resonate
   - Value networks achieve higher modes
   - Trust relationships phase lock
   - Understanding evolves through resonance

## Mechanism Properties

1. **Stability**
   - Nash equilibrium at resonance
   - Robust against dissonance
   - Self-tuning dynamics
   - Sustainable wave creation

2. **Adaptability**
   - Responds to new frequencies
   - Incorporates harmonic innovation
   - Evolves through phase space
   - Maintains coherence

## Value Alignment

The mechanism naturally aligns through resonance:
- Individual waves with collective fields
- Short-term modes with long-term harmonics
- Local oscillations with global patterns
- Personal frequency with shared resonance

Through these harmonic game principles, Choir creates conditions where:
- Quality emerges through resonance
- Value flows to harmonic truth
- Complexity serves wave coherence
- Evolution maintains phase integrity

The beauty is that oscillators don't need to understand these deeper patterns - following local phase relationships naturally leads to global resonance optimization.
