# Deploy Predeployment Guide

This guide will help you create a Dockerfile for deploying your project locally and then on Azure. Containerizing your application makes it easier to deploy and manage across different environments.

## Step 1: Create a Dockerfile

1. **Base Image**: Choose a base image that matches your application's runtime environment. For a Node.js application, you might use `node:18-alpine` for a lightweight image.

2. **Set Working Directory**: Set the working directory inside the container.

3. **Copy Files**: Copy your application files into the container.

4. **Install Dependencies**: Install the necessary dependencies using `pnpm`.

5. **Build Application**: If your application requires a build step (e.g., for a React app), include it.

6. **Expose Ports**: Expose the necessary ports for your application.

7. **Run the Application**: Specify the command to run your application.

Here's a sample Dockerfile for a Node.js application using `pnpm`:

```dockerfile
# Use the official Node.js image.
# https://hub.docker.com/_/node
FROM node:18-alpine

# Install pnpm
RUN npm install -g pnpm

# Set the working directory
WORKDIR /app

# Copy package.json and pnpm-lock.yaml
COPY package.json pnpm-lock.yaml ./

# Install dependencies
RUN pnpm install

# Copy the rest of the application code
COPY . .

# Build the application (if needed)
RUN pnpm run build

# Expose the port the app runs on
EXPOSE 3000

# Run the application
CMD ["pnpm", "start"]
```

## Step 2: Build and Run the Docker Image Locally

1. **Build the Docker Image**: Run the following command in the directory containing your Dockerfile:

   ```bash
   docker build -t choir-collective .
   ```

2. **Run the Docker Container**: Start a container from the image:

   ```bash
   docker run -p 3000:3000 choir-collective
   ```

   This maps port 3000 on your host to port 3000 in the container.

## Step 3: Deploy to Azure

1. **Create an Azure Container Registry (ACR)**: If you don't have one, create it using the Azure portal or CLI.

2. **Login to ACR**: Use the Azure CLI to log in to your ACR.

   ```bash
   az acr login --name <your-acr-name>
   ```

3. **Tag the Docker Image**: Tag your Docker image for the ACR.

   ```bash
   docker tag choir-collective <your-acr-name>.azurecr.io/choir-collective
   ```

4. **Push the Image to ACR**: Push your Docker image to the ACR.

   ```bash
   docker push <your-acr-name>.azurecr.io/choir-collective
   ```

5. **Deploy to Azure App Service**: Use Azure App Service to deploy the container.

   ```bash
   az webapp create --resource-group <your-resource-group> --plan <your-app-service-plan> --name <your-app-name> --deployment-container-image-name <your-acr-name>.azurecr.io/choir-collective
   ```

6. **Configure Continuous Deployment (Optional)**: Set up continuous deployment from your ACR to Azure App Service for automatic updates.

## Step 4: Verify Deployment

1. **Access the Application**: Visit the URL provided by Azure App Service to ensure your application is running.

2. **Monitor Logs**: Use Azure's monitoring tools to check logs and ensure everything is functioning correctly.

This guide provides a basic framework for containerizing and deploying your application. You can customize the Dockerfile and deployment steps based on your specific requirements and application architecture.
