# Token Settlement and Distribution

VERSION settlement_system:
  invariants: {
    "Token conservation",
    "Distribution atomicity",
    "Settlement finality"
  }
  assumptions: {
    "Token account availability",
    "Transaction ordering",
    "Escrow security"
  }
  implementation: "0.1.0"

## Core Settlement Types

TYPE Settlement = {
  thread: Thread,
  stake: TokenAmount,
  participants: Set<PublicKey>,
  outcome: SettlementOutcome,
  metadata: SettlementMetadata
}

TYPE SettlementOutcome =
  | Unanimous: stake -> thread_balance
  | Denied: stake -> denier_accounts
  | Mixed: stake -> treasury
  | Expired: stake -> treasury
  | Divest: thread_balance/n -> co_author

TYPE SettlementMetadata = {
  timestamp: i64,
  transaction_id: Hash,
  settlement_type: SettlementType,
  participants: Set<PublicKey>
}

## Settlement Operations

SEQUENCE process_settlement:
  1. Validation
     - Verify token accounts
     - Check balances
     - Validate authorities
     - Verify preconditions

  2. Settlement Execution
     - Lock source accounts
     - Calculate distributions
     - Process transfers
     - Update state

  3. Verification
     - Check token conservation
     - Verify final balances
     - Validate state updates
     - Emit events

PROPERTY settlement_atomicity:
  FORALL s IN settlements:
    s.complete OR s.reverted

## Distribution Logic

SEQUENCE calculate_distribution:
  1. Outcome Analysis
     - Determine settlement type
     - Count participants
     - Calculate shares
     - Verify totals

  2. Account Preparation
     - Verify recipient accounts
     - Check account ownership
     - Validate permissions
     - Reserve balances

  3. Transfer Execution
     - Process in order
     - Update balances
     - Record transfers
     - Emit events

PROPERTY distribution_fairness:
  FORALL share IN distribution:
    share == total_amount / participant_count

## Token Account Management

TYPE TokenAccounts = {
  thread: Account<TokenAccount>,
  escrow: Account<TokenAccount>,
  treasury: Account<TokenAccount>,
  participant_accounts: Map<PublicKey, Account<TokenAccount>>
}

SEQUENCE manage_accounts:
  1. Account Validation
     - Verify ownership
     - Check authorities
     - Validate balances
     - Verify PDAs

  2. Balance Management
     - Lock amounts
     - Process transfers
     - Update balances
     - Release locks

  3. State Synchronization
     - Update thread state
     - Record settlements
     - Emit events
     - Verify consistency

PROPERTY account_integrity:
  FORALL account IN token_accounts:
    valid_owner(account) AND
    valid_authority(account) AND
    valid_balance(account)

## Settlement Flows

1. **Unanimous Approval**
   ```
   SEQUENCE settle_unanimous:
     1. Verify unanimous consent
     2. Transfer stake to thread
     3. Update thread balance
     4. Record settlement
   ```

2. **Denial Settlement**
   ```
   SEQUENCE settle_denial:
     1. Calculate denier shares
     2. Transfer to deniers
     3. Update balances
     4. Record settlement
   ```

3. **Mixed Outcome**
   ```
   SEQUENCE settle_mixed:
     1. Calculate treasury portion
     2. Transfer to treasury
     3. Update state
     4. Record settlement
   ```

4. **Divestment**
   ```
   SEQUENCE settle_divest:
     1. Calculate co-author share
     2. Process transfer
     3. Update thread state
     4. Record settlement
   ```

## Security Properties

1. **Conservation**
   ```
   PROPERTY token_conservation:
     FORALL settlement IN settlements:
       sum(inputs) == sum(outputs) AND
       all_accounts_valid() AND
       no_tokens_created()
   ```

2. **Authority**
   ```
   PROPERTY settlement_authority:
     FORALL transfer IN transfers:
       authorized_source(transfer) AND
       valid_destination(transfer) AND
       approved_amount(transfer)
   ```

3. **Finality**
   ```
   PROPERTY settlement_finality:
     FORALL s IN settlements:
       completed(s) IMPLIES
         irreversible(s) AND
         recorded(s) AND
         verified(s)
   ```

## Error Handling

TYPE SettlementError =
  | InsufficientBalance
  | InvalidAccount
  | UnauthorizedTransfer
  | SettlementFailed
  | AccountMismatch

FUNCTION handle_settlement_error(error: SettlementError) -> Result<()>:
  revert_transfers()
  unlock_accounts()
  emit_error_event(error)
  RETURN Err(error)

## Implementation Notes

The settlement system maintains several critical properties:

1. Token Safety
   - All transfers are atomic
   - Balances are always conserved
   - Accounts are properly validated
   - Authorities are strictly checked

2. Settlement Integrity
   - Outcomes are deterministic
   - Distributions are fair
   - State is consistent
   - Events are recorded

3. Error Recovery
   - Failed settlements revert
   - Accounts are unlocked
   - State is preserved
   - Events are emitted

Through these mechanisms, the settlement system provides secure and reliable token distribution while maintaining strong consistency guarantees.
