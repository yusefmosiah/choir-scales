## Mission

ASSUMPTION platform_focus:
  "Chat-based content generation"
  "May expand to other content types"
  "Must maintain quality control"

To create the world's highest signal human dataset by leveraging a decentralized, token-driven chat platform, ultimately developing AI models that excel in qualitative, stylistic, and artistic dimensions.

## The Problem

Traditional AI models demonstrate impressive technical capabilities but lack the qualitative nuances that characterize human expression. Content generated by these models often fails to capture stylistic nuance, artistic flair, and meaningful context, resulting in a disconnect with human audiences.

## The Solution: Choir

**Choir** is a decentralized, chat-based platform where users engage in collaborative discussions. Messages are curated through a collective approval mechanism, ensuring only high-quality content is published. By integrating blockchain technology and innovative tokenomics, Choir incentivizes users to produce valuable content, fostering an ecosystem that prioritizes quality over quantity.

### Key Features

- **Collaborative Message Ownership and Approval**
  - Users own the messages they submit.
  - Threads are owned collectively by the creators of the messages within them (co-authors).
  - Messages require unanimous approval from co-authors to be published.
  - Non-co-authors can pay CHOIR tokens to submit a speculative response ("spec"), which can be accepted or denied by co-authors within a 7-day window.

- **Access Control and Incentivization**
  - Co-authors have read-write access to their threads.
  - Non-co-authors can view AI-generated summaries of threads.
  - Ownership enables access control and distribution of CHOIR token rewards.
  - The ownership model is essential for distributing rewards to message creators and authors of cited sources.

- **CHOIR Token Mechanics**
  - Tokens are used for staking, rewarding contributions, and aligning incentives.
  - A fixed supply ensures scarcity and value preservation.
  - When a new message is approved, staked tokens go to the thread's token balance.
  - When a message is denied, rejecting co-authors split the staked tokens.
  - Threads have Solana accounts that store CHOIR tokens.

- **AI-Generated Summaries**
  - Non-co-authors access AI-generated summaries of threads.
  - Summaries are designed to create interest and stimulate engagement.
  - AI summaries will improve over time and are not intended as strict privacy measures.

## How It Works

1. **Message Contribution and Ownership**

   - Users submit messages to threads, becoming owners of their messages.
   - The initial thread creator is the first co-author.
   - Threads are owned by the co-authors (message creators) within them.

2. **Speculative Responses ("Specs")**

   - Non-co-authors can pay CHOIR tokens to submit a "spec" to a thread.
   - Co-authors have a 7-day window to approve or deny the spec.
   - **Unanimous Approval**: Spec is published; the contributor becomes a co-author.
   - **Denial**: Spec is rejected; rejecting co-authors split the staked tokens.

3. **Token Distribution and Thread Economics**

   - Approved messages result in staked tokens being added to the thread's token balance.
   - Threads act as entities manifesting connections between people.
   - Co-authors share ownership and can divest their token share at any time.

4. **Access and AI Summaries**

   - **Co-authors**: Full read-write access to the thread.
   - **Non-co-authors**: Access to AI-generated summaries to encourage engagement.
   - Summaries compress content to tease the full discussion and stimulate interest.

## The Benefits

- **High-Quality Content**: Ownership and approval mechanisms ensure valuable messages are published.
- **Incentivized Collaboration**: Tokenomics align user incentives with platform goals.
- **Secure and Controlled Access**: Ownership structures provide control over thread participation and content visibility.
- **AI Advancement**: The curated dataset serves as ideal training data for advanced AI models.
- **Community Engagement**: Encourages meaningful interactions and fosters trust among users.

## Roadmap Highlights
- **October 2023**: Launch of the MVP with core functionalities
- **April 2025**: Release of the first AI model trained on the token-scored dataset
- **Beyond**: Expansion of platform features, governance integration, and continuous AI development
