## State Evolution

The thread state algebra naturally extends to asset holding. A thread's state evolves from pure message coordination to asset custody through well-defined transitions. Each stage maintains the core properties of co-authorship while adding new capabilities.

## Asset Custody Properties

Thread PDAs serve multiple roles:
- Message coordination (base layer)
- Token custody (CHOIR and others)
- Revenue collection
- Asset registration
- Value distribution

These roles compose algebraically, preserving ownership and access control invariants.

## Economic Bridges

The token mechanics bridge multiple value domains:
- Content quality staking
- Asset custody rights
- Revenue distribution
- Innovation capture
- Network effects

Each domain adds new state transitions while preserving existing guarantees.

## Security Composition

Asset custody builds on thread security:
- Co-author unanimous approval
- Stake-based participation
- Timeout mechanisms
- Recovery procedures

The security model composes vertically across asset types.

## Implementation Patterns

Asset integration follows core patterns:
- State transitions remain atomic
- Ownership rules compose
- Privacy guarantees extend
- Value flows preserve conservation

## Documentation Integration

This model connects to:
- StateAlgebra.md: Extended state types
- SecurityModel.md: Asset custody rules
- EconomicModel.md: Value flow patterns
- CoreInvariants.md: Asset properties

Through these connections, thread asset evolution becomes a natural extension of the core system rather than a separate concern.
