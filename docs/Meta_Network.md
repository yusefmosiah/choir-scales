# Choir Documentation Network Model

VERSION doc_network:
  invariants: {
    "Cross-reference completeness",
    "Relationship accuracy",
    "Network connectivity"
  }
  assumptions: {
    "Document stability",
    "Reference validity",
    "Topic clustering"
  }
  implementation: "0.1.0"

## State Management Cluster

The state management documentation forms a tightly coupled cluster centered around state transitions and consistency. StateAlgebra.md provides the formal mathematical foundation, while StateTransitions.md and StateMachine.md implement these concepts in concrete terms. StateManagement.md bridges these formal definitions with practical implementation patterns.

Key relationships:
- StateAlgebra.md ← StateMachine.md (implements formal algebra)
- StateTransitions.md ← StateManagement.md (applies transitions)
- StateMachine.md ↔ StateManagement.md (bidirectional implementation)

## Development Planning Cluster

The development documentation cluster shows how implementation plans evolve from context. Context.md provides the foundational understanding that informs ChorusDevPlan.md and RebasePlan.md. These documents share significant overlap in timeline and resource allocation while maintaining distinct focuses.

Key relationships:
- Context.md → ChorusDevPlan.md (informs development)
- Context.md → RebasePlan.md (guides rebase strategy)
- ChorusDevPlan.md ↔ RebasePlan.md (timeline alignment)

## Visual Documentation Cluster

The visual documentation cluster centers around Diagrams.md, which provides graphical representations that complement multiple other documents. graph.md offers specialized network visualizations that integrate with state and development documentation.

Key relationships:
- Diagrams.md → StateTransitions.md (flow visualization)
- Diagrams.md → ChorusDevPlan.md (architecture diagrams)
- graph.md ↔ StateManagement.md (state network visualization)

## Conceptual Foundation Cluster

The conceptual cluster establishes core platform understanding through Whitepaper.md and related high-level documents. These documents share fundamental concepts that flow through the entire documentation network.

Key relationships:
- Whitepaper.md → Context.md (establishes foundation)
- Whitepaper.md → StateAlgebra.md (formalizes concepts)
- Context.md ↔ MetaDocumentation.md (guides organization)

## Cross-Cluster Relationships

Several documents serve as bridges between clusters:

1. State-Development Bridge:
   - StateManagement.md → ChorusDevPlan.md (implementation guidance)
   - RebasePlan.md → StateTransitions.md (migration patterns)

2. Visual-State Bridge:
   - Diagrams.md → StateMachine.md (state visualization)
   - graph.md → StateAlgebra.md (formal graph representation)

3. Conceptual-Implementation Bridge:
   - Context.md → StateManagement.md (requirements flow)
   - Whitepaper.md → ChorusDevPlan.md (architectural alignment)

## Network Evolution

The documentation network evolves through several mechanisms:

1. Vertical Growth:
   - Concept refinement (Whitepaper.md → StateAlgebra.md)
   - Implementation detail (StateAlgebra.md → StateMachine.md)
   - Practical application (StateMachine.md → StateManagement.md)

2. Horizontal Growth:
   - Cross-domain integration (StateManagement.md ↔ ChorusDevPlan.md)
   - Visual representation (Diagrams.md ↔ multiple documents)
   - Context sharing (Context.md ↔ multiple documents)

## Network Maintenance

To maintain network coherence:

1. Reference Integrity:
   - All cross-references must be bidirectional
   - References must include section specificity
   - Version compatibility must be maintained

2. Cluster Cohesion:
   - Documents within clusters maintain consistent terminology
   - Shared concepts are defined in common locations
   - Implementation details flow from formal definitions

3. Bridge Stability:
   - Cross-cluster references maintain clear scope
   - Implementation details respect formal definitions
   - Visual representations match textual descriptions

Through this network model, we can better understand and maintain the relationships between Choir's documentation components, ensuring consistency and completeness across the system.
