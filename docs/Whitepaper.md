# Choir Tokenomics Whitepaper

## Abstract

Choir presents an innovative socioeconomic media network that leverages blockchain technology to redefine content creation, curation, and collaboration. Central to Choir's ecosystem is the Choir Token (CHOIR), a cryptocurrency meticulously designed to incentivize meaningful contributions, foster high-quality content, and promote collaborative editing. This whitepaper delineates the comprehensive tokenomics of Choir, elucidating the mechanisms of token distribution, circulation, and economic incentives that underpin user engagement and platform sustainability. A key feature of Choir is the integration of an interactive Authors Chat during the edit proposal process, enhancing collaborative decision-making and content quality through a user-friendly interface.

## Introduction

In the digital landscape, the proliferation of content has democratized information sharing but has also introduced challenges related to content quality, credibility, and meaningful collaboration. Traditional social media platforms often rely on centralized algorithms that prioritize engagement over substance, leading to issues like misinformation and low-quality content proliferation.

Choir addresses these challenges by creating a decentralized platform where content and its metadata are treated as valuable assets. By integrating blockchain technology and a thoughtfully designed token economy, Choir incentivizes users to produce original, high-quality content, engage in collaborative editing, and invest in the platform's growth. The introduction of an interactive Authors Chat during edit proposals further enhances collaboration, allowing authors and editors to discuss, refine, and reach consensus on content improvements through a seamless user interface. This approach not only enhances content quality but also fosters a vibrant, engaged community.

## Token Flow Mechanics

### 1. Initial Token Allocation

- **Minting**: 10 billion CHOIR tokens are minted to the Choir Treasury at platform inception.
- **Purpose**: Serves as the foundational economic resource for rewarding user activities and maintaining platform operations.

### 2. Content Creation Rewards

- **Mechanism**: Users earn tokens by creating original content.
- **Variable Reward System**:
  - **Semantic Sparsity Factor**: The reward for content creation is inversely proportional to the density of similar content in the semantic space.
  - **High-Entropy Content Incentivization**: Unique, high-quality, and innovative content receives higher rewards, promoting diversity and originality.
- **Formula**:

  \[
  \text{Reward} = T_c \times \left(1 + \frac{S_{\text{max}} - S_{\text{content}}}{S_{\text{max}}} \right)
  \]

  - \( T_c \): Base token reward per content creation.
  - \( S_{\text{content}} \): Semantic similarity score of the new content to existing content.
  - \( S_{\text{max}} \): Maximum possible similarity score.

- **Token Allocation**:
  - **Creators**: Receive a portion of the minted tokens based on content uniqueness.
  - **Content's Token Balance**: Accumulates tokens, enhancing content visibility and ranking.

### 3. Automatic Citation Rewards

- **Mechanism**: When new content is created, the system automatically cites relevant existing content using a reranking algorithm.
- **User Interface Integration**:
  - **Chat Threads**: Citations appear as new messages in the chat thread of the cited content.
  - **Notification Indicators**: Tabs or chat threads change color or display badges to indicate new unread citation messages.
- **Token Distribution**:
  - **Cited Authors**: Receive tokens as a reward for their content being referenced.
  - **Allocation Ratio**: A predefined fraction of the content creation reward is allocated for citations.

### 4. Collaborative Editing and Token Investment

- **Edit Proposals**:
  - **Process**: Users propose edits to existing content by staking tokens in an edit escrow contract.
  - **Staking Requirement**: A fixed number of tokens must be staked to initiate an edit proposal, representing an investment in the content's improvement.
- **User Interface and Authors Chat**:
  - **Edit Requests as Chat Messages**:
    - **Appearance**: Edit requests appear as new messages in the chat thread of the content being edited.
    - **Interactive Elements**: Messages include discrete options or buttons for authors to tap/click, such as approve or reject.
  - **Notification System**:
    - **Visual Indicators**: Tabs or chat threads highlight new edit requests through color changes or notification badges.
    - **Email/App Notifications**: Authors receive notifications about new edit requests and messages.
  - **Communication and Collaboration**:
    - **Responses**: Authors can respond to edit requests within the chat thread, engaging in discussion.
    - **Cross-Thread Updates**: Responses are mirrored in the chat threads of all involved parties, ensuring synchronized communication.
    - **Iterative Editing**: Editors can revise their proposals based on feedback received in the Authors Chat until consensus is reached.
- **Approval Process**:
  - **Review Window**: Co-authors have a 7-day period to review the proposed edit.
  - **Approval Mechanism**: A mix of abstentions and approvals with no rejections results in approval.
  - **Rejection Mechanism**: If there are only abstentions or if any co-author rejects, the edit is denied.
  - **Token Distribution on Approval**:
    - **Content Account**: Receives the staked tokens, increasing its token balance.
    - **Editor**: Gains co-authorship status and a share of the content's token balance.
  - **Token Distribution on Denial**:
    - **Rejecting Authors**: Staked tokens are distributed among rejecting authors.
    - **Abstention-only Case**: Tokens are returned to the editor.

### 5. Divestment and Token Extraction

- **Divestment Mechanism**:
  - **Process**: Authors can choose to divest their share of tokens from a content account at any time.
  - **Token Retrieval**: Upon divestment, an author receives \( \frac{\text{Content Account Tokens}}{n - 1} \) tokens, where \( n \) is the total number of co-authors.
- **Examples**:
  - **7 Authors**: An author divesting receives \( \frac{\text{Content Tokens}}{6} \).
  - **2 Authors**: A divesting author receives all tokens in the content account, leaving the remaining author with an empty account.
- **Economic Implications**:
  - **Fair Token Distribution**: Ensures that tokens are fairly redistributed among remaining authors when one author divests.
  - **Hot Potato Dynamics**: Encourages active investment in content by allowing authors who no longer believe in its value to divest, transferring control to those who do.
  - **Content as an Asset**: Reinforces the notion of content being a valuable, buyable, and sellable asset within the platform.

## Preventing Token Inflation and Ensuring Sustainability

### Fixed Token Supply

- **Hard Cap**: The total supply of 10 billion CHOIR tokens ensures that the ecosystem remains deflationary, preserving token value over time.

### Dynamic Reward Adjustment
