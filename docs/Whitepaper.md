# Choir Tokenomics Whitepaper (MVP Version)

## Abstract

Choir introduces an innovative socioeconomic media network leveraging blockchain technology to redefine collaborative communication and content curation. This whitepaper outlines the simplified tokenomics for the Choir MVP, focusing on the essential mechanisms that will demonstrate the platform's potential.

## Introduction

The Choir MVP aims to address challenges in digital communication related to content quality and meaningful collaboration. By integrating a basic blockchain-based token system and a collaborative approval mechanism, Choir incentivizes users to contribute valuable messages and engage responsibly.

## Token Overview (MVP Version)

- **Token Name**: Choir Token (Mock Version)
- **Token Symbol**: CHOIR
- **Total Supply**: Limited supply for MVP testing
- **Token Standard**: Simulated SPL Token (full Solana integration post-MVP)

## Key Entities in the Choir Ecosystem (MVP)

1. **Users**: Participants who contribute messages to chat threads.
2. **Chat Threads**: Collaborative spaces for discussions.
3. **Message Approval Mechanism**: Simplified consensus system for content curation.
4. **Mock Choir Treasury**: Simulated central repository for token distribution.

## Token Flow Mechanics (Simplified for MVP)

1. **Message Contribution and Staking**
   - Users stake a predefined amount of mock CHOIR tokens to submit messages.

2. **Simplified Approval Process**
   - Co-authors have basic rights to approve or deny messages.
   - Unanimous approval required for message publication.

3. **Basic Token Distribution**
   - Approved messages result in simple token rewards.
   - Denied messages may result in token redistribution (simplified version).

4. **Co-authorship Dynamics**
   - Users become co-authors of threads they contribute to.
   - Basic implementation of shared thread ownership.

## MVP Limitations and Future Enhancements

- The MVP features a simplified version of the full tokenomics model.
- Post-MVP plans include implementing full Solana integration, enhancing the approval process, and developing more sophisticated co-authorship features.

## Conclusion

The Choir MVP demonstrates the core concepts of collaborative content creation and curation through a basic token-driven system. This foundation sets the stage for future development of a fully decentralized platform that incentivizes high-quality discourse and fosters a vibrant community of contributors.
