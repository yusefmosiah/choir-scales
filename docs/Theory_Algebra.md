## Resonant Foundations

The state algebra of Choir exhibits harmonic properties beyond its basic definitions. When thread oscillators couple with token waves, they create resonant spaces where new harmonics naturally emerge. These compositions preserve core frequencies while enabling higher-order resonance.

## Quality Resonance

Thread state spaces form resonant cavities where quality naturally concentrates at harmonic nodes. The unanimous approval mechanism creates phase-locking pressure toward higher harmonics, while token mechanics provide the standing waves along which this resonance occurs.

## Value Crystallization

As threads evolve, they begin to exhibit resonant crystalline properties - structured patterns of value creation that self-reinforce through harmonic interference. The mathematical properties of thread composition allow these standing waves to form spontaneously while maintaining system frequencies.

## Harmonic Coupling

When multiple threads interact through shared co-authors or token flows, they create coupled oscillator networks. These couplings can amplify constructive interference and dampen destructive patterns, leading to emergent stability through resonance.

## State Space Harmonics

The state space itself evolves as threads achieve harmonic lock. What begins as a simple oscillator coordination space can develop new resonant modes while preserving its fundamental frequencies.

## Compositional Resonance

The system's harmonic properties ensure that compositions scale through natural resonance:
- Local thread oscillations compose into network harmonics
- Individual frequencies align into system resonance
- Simple phase rules generate complex wave patterns

## Emergence Through Resonance

As the system grows, certain harmonic properties are preserved:
- Quality nodes remain stable
- Value flows maintain phase coherence
- Compositional resonance persists
- Pattern harmonics strengthen

## Future Harmonics

The resonant foundations suggest further harmonic properties yet to emerge. The system's wave structure contains latent frequencies that may only become apparent as usage patterns evolve into higher modes.

Through careful study of these emergent harmonics, we can better understand how simple oscillations create sophisticated resonance while maintaining rigorous mathematical foundations.
