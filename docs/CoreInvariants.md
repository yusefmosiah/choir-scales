# Choir Core Invariants

VERSION core_system:
  invariants: {
    "System-wide state consistency",
    "Economic conservation laws",
    "Security boundaries"
  }
  assumptions: {
    "Invariant verification methods",
    "Recovery procedures",
    "Monitoring approaches"
  }
  implementation: "0.1.0"

## System Invariants

ASSUMPTION invariant_checking:
  "Real-time invariant verification"
  "May introduce async verification"
  "Must catch all violations"

1. **Thread Ownership**
   - A thread MUST always have at least one co-author
   - Co-authors MUST be unique within a thread
   - Only co-authors MAY approve or deny specs
   - Thread token balance MUST equal sum of all successful stakes minus distributions

2. **Message Integrity**
   - Each message MUST have a unique content hash
   - Content hash on Solana MUST match content hash in Qdrant
   - Message author MUST be either co-author or spec submitter
   - Message timestamp MUST be after thread creation time

3. **Token Economics**
   - Total token supply MUST remain constant (10 billion)
   - Thread token balance MUST never be negative
   - Stake amount MUST meet minimum requirement
   - Token distributions MUST be atomic and complete

## State Transition Rules

ASSUMPTION state_transitions:
  "Synchronous transition verification"
  "May introduce batched transitions"
  "Must maintain atomicity"

1. **Thread Creation**
   INVARIANT create_thread(creator) -> thread:
     - thread.co_authors = [creator]
     - thread.token_balance = 0
     - thread.created_at <= now()
     - EMITS ThreadCreated

2. **Spec Submission**
   INVARIANT submit_spec(author, thread, stake) -> spec:
     - author NOT IN thread.co_authors
     - stake >= MINIMUM_STAKE
     - spec.expires_at = now() + 7 days
     - EMITS SpecSubmitted

3. **Approval Processing**
   INVARIANT process_approval(co_author, spec, decision) -> result:
     - co_author IN thread.co_authors
     - spec.expires_at > now()
     - NOT already_voted(co_author, spec)
     - EMITS ApprovalProcessed

4. **Token Distribution**
   INVARIANT distribute_tokens(thread, recipients, amount):
     - amount <= thread.token_balance
     - recipients.all IN thread.co_authors
     - sum(distributions) = amount
     - EMITS TokensDistributed

## Security Properties

ASSUMPTION security_verification:
  "Continuous security property verification"
  "May introduce formal verification"
  "Must catch all violations immediately"

1. **Access Control**
   - Only co-authors MAY modify thread state
   - Only spec author MAY cancel unexpired spec
   - Only Choir Treasury MAY mint tokens
   - Only thread PDA MAY hold thread tokens

2. **Temporal Constraints**
   - Specs MUST be processed within 7 days
   - Approvals MUST be processed in order
   - State updates MUST be atomic
   - Events MUST be ordered

3. **Economic Security**
   - Stake MUST be locked until decision
   - Divestment MUST be proportional
   - Rejecting co-authors MUST split stakes equally
   - Treasury MUST recapture split decision tokens

## Data Integrity

ASSUMPTION data_verification:
  "Hash-based integrity verification"
  "May introduce additional verification methods"
  "Must maintain perfect accuracy"

1. **Content Storage**
   - Message content MUST be stored in Qdrant
   - Content hash MUST be stored on Solana
   - Premium user content MAY be unsearchable
   - Content MUST be immutable once approved

2. **State Consistency**
   - Solana state MUST be source of truth for ownership
   - Qdrant state MUST be source of truth for content
   - State transitions MUST be reversible
   - State MUST be recoverable from events

## Implementation Notes

NOTE verification_implementation:
  "Current implementation uses direct checking"
  "May introduce automated verification"
  "Must maintain real-time guarantees"

NOTE recovery_procedures:
  "Current recovery uses checkpointing"
  "May introduce continuous backup"
  "Must guarantee complete recovery"
