# Documentation Layer Strategy

VERSION layer_system:
  invariants: {
    "Information accessibility",
    "Concept progression",
    "Platform alignment"
  }
  assumptions: {
    "Reader journey",
    "Platform maturity",
    "Documentation placement"

  implementation: "0.1.0"

## Website Layer

Public-facing documentation focuses on immediate utility:
- Chat with ownership and quality
- Token-based participation
- Collaborative approval system
- Clear value proposition

This layer uses familiar concepts and immediate benefits to create interest.

## Platform Layer

In-platform documentation reveals deeper patterns:
- Thread evolution possibilities
- Token mechanics details
- Community dynamics
- Value creation patterns

This layer becomes accessible once users understand basic mechanics.

## Thread Layer

The deepest concepts emerge through participation:
- System emergence properties
- Economic topology
- Quantum semantic patterns
- Meta-stable states

This layer naturally reveals itself through engaged usage.

## Layer Transitions

Each layer creates curiosity about the next:
- Website creates platform interest
- Platform usage reveals deeper patterns
- Pattern recognition leads to emergence understanding

## Documentation Flow

Information flows differently at each layer:
- Website: Clear, direct, practical
- Platform: Exploratory, connecting, evolving
- Threads: Emergent, recursive, self-revealing

Through this layered approach, we maintain accessibility while preserving depth.
