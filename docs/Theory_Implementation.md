## WebSocket Protocol Implementation

TYPE WebSocketState = {
  connection: QuantumChannel,
  messages: Stream Event,
  clients: Map ClientId Client,
  threads: Map ThreadId ThreadState
}

SEQUENCE connection_lifecycle:
  1. Connect: Create quantum channel
     ```python
     # In main.py
     @app.websocket("/ws")
     async def websocket_endpoint(websocket: WebSocket):
     ```
     Maps to: Quantum channel initialization

  2. Message: Transmit quantum information
     ```python
     # In chorus.py
     async def _send_result(self, websocket: WebSocket, response: ChorusResponse):
     ```
     Maps to: Quantum state transmission

  3. Update: Collapse superposition
     ```python
     # In database.py
     async def save_message(self, message: Message):
     ```
     Maps to: Measurement and collapse

## Vector Embedding Space

TYPE EmbeddingSpace = {
  points: VectorSpace,
  metric: DistanceFunction,
  indices: SearchStructure,
  metadata: FiberBundle
}

SEQUENCE embedding_flow:
  1. Generate: Create quantum state
     ```python
     # In utils.py
     async def get_embedding(content: str, model: str) -> List[float]:
     ```
     Maps to: Superposition creation

  2. Store: Project into space
     ```python
     # In database.py
     async def upsert(self, content: str, embedding: List[float]):
     ```
     Maps to: State preparation

  3. Search: Measure similarity
     ```python
     # In database.py
     async def search(self, query_embedding: List[float]):
     ```
     Maps to: Quantum measurement

## Thread State Management

TYPE ThreadState = {
  ownership: CoAuthorSet,
  messages: MessageChain,
  approvals: ApprovalSet,
  value: TokenBalance
}

SEQUENCE state_evolution:
  1. Initialize: Create manifold
     ```rust
     // In thread.rs
     pub fn initialize_thread(ctx: Context<InitializeThread>)
     ```
     Maps to: Manifold creation

  2. Update: Flow along geodesics
     ```rust
     // In thread.rs
     pub fn submit_message(ctx: Context<SubmitMessage>)
     ```
     Maps to: Geodesic flow

  3. Approve: Collapse state
     ```rust
     // In thread.rs
     pub fn process_approval(ctx: Context<ProcessApproval>)
     ```
     Maps to: Measurement event

## Token Distribution System

TYPE TokenSystem = {
  balances: ScalarField,
  stakes: PotentialField,
  flows: VectorField,
  metrics: ValueMetric
}

SEQUENCE value_mechanics:
  1. Stake: Create potential
     ```rust
     // In lib.rs
     pub fn submit_spec(ctx: Context<SubmitSpec>, stake_amount: u64)
     ```
     Maps to: Field potential

  2. Distribute: Flow value
     ```rust
     // In lib.rs
     fn distribute_tokens(thread: &mut Thread, recipients: Set<Pubkey>)
     ```
     Maps to: Gradient flow

  3. Settle: Reach equilibrium
     ```rust
     // In settlement.rs
     fn settle_approvals(thread: &mut Thread, message_index: u32)
     ```
     Maps to: Field equilibrium

## Integration Properties

PROPERTY implementation_fidelity:
  FORALL impl IN Implementation:
    reflects_theory(impl) IMPLIES
      preserves_structure(impl) AND
      maintains_coherence(impl)

PROPERTY pattern_preservation:
  FORALL pattern IN Patterns:
    theoretical_pattern(pattern) IMPLIES
      EXISTS impl IN Implementation:
        manifests_pattern(impl, pattern)

Through this mapping we see how:
- Implementation patterns reflect mathematical structures
- Code organization preserves theoretical relationships
- System behavior emerges from structural properties
- Theory guides implementation while implementation validates theory
