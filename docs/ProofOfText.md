# Proof of Text: Choir's Consensus Mechanism

VERSION consensus_system:
  invariants: {
    "Quality-driven content curation",
    "Stake-based participation",
    "Collaborative approval process"
  }
  assumptions: {
    "Approval timeframes",
    "Stake requirements",
    "Distribution mechanics"
  }
  implementation: "0.1.0"

## Core Mechanism

ASSUMPTION consensus_model:
  "Unanimous approval requirement"
  "May introduce weighted voting"
  "Must maintain quality control"

1. **Message Contribution and Staking**

   ASSUMPTION stake_requirements:
     "Fixed minimum stake requirement"
     "May introduce dynamic stake scaling"
     "Must prevent spam while enabling participation"

   - Users stake CHOIR tokens for spec submissions
   - Stake amount must meet thread minimum
   - Stake locked until decision finalized

2. **Collaborative Approval**

   ASSUMPTION approval_process:
     "7-day approval window"
     "May adjust timeframe based on usage"
     "Must allow sufficient review time"

   - Co-authors review within approval window
   - Unanimous approval required for publication
   - Any denial triggers stake distribution

3. **Token Distribution**

   ASSUMPTION distribution_model:
     "Equal distribution to deniers"
     "May introduce weighted distribution"
     "Must maintain incentive alignment"

   - Approved: stake to thread balance
   - Denied: stake to deniers
   - Mixed: excess to treasury

## Quality Assurance

ASSUMPTION quality_metrics:
  "Implicit quality through stake/approval"
  "May introduce explicit quality metrics"
  "Must maintain organic curation"

1. **Incentive Alignment**
   - Stake requirement ensures commitment
   - Co-authors incentivized to maintain quality
   - Denial rewards protect thread value

2. **Collaborative Filtering**
   - Co-authors act as quality gatekeepers
   - Unanimous approval ensures high standards
   - Economic penalties for low quality

## Implementation Notes

NOTE approval_dynamics:
  "Current implementation uses simple voting"
  "May introduce reputation-weighted voting"
  "Must maintain quality guarantees"

NOTE economic_balance:
  "Current parameters set conservatively"
  "May adjust based on observed behavior"
  "Must maintain economic sustainability"

## Future Considerations

ASSUMPTION mechanism_evolution:
  "Basic proof-of-text v1"
  "May introduce additional consensus features"
  "Must preserve core quality principles"

1. **Governance Integration**
   - Parameter adjustment voting
   - Protocol upgrade proposals
   - Treasury management

2. **Advanced Features**
   - Reputation-based stake requirements
   - Dynamic approval timeframes
   - Complex reward structures
