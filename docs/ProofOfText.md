# Choir Proof of Text: Ensuring Content Quality Through Collaborative Chat

---

## Introduction

In the evolving landscape of digital communication, maintaining high-quality content while fostering genuine user engagement remains a significant challenge. Traditional platforms often grapple with issues like content moderation, spam, and lack of incentive alignment. **Choir** addresses these challenges by introducing a novel consensus mechanism known as **Proof of Text** within a chat-based platform. This mechanism ensures content integrity, fosters collaboration, and aligns incentives within its decentralized ecosystem.

## Understanding the Importance of Text in Content Quality

Text-based communication forms the backbone of meaningful discourse online. By focusing on textual interactions, Choir emphasizes clarity, depth, and substance in conversations. The Proof of Text mechanism leverages collaborative message approvals to maintain high standards of content quality.

## The Proof of Text Mechanism

### 1. Message Contribution and Staking

- **Staking Requirement**: Users stake a predefined amount of **CHOIR** tokens to submit messages to threads where they are not co-authors.
- **Purpose**: Discourages spam and ensures contributors have a vested interest in the thread's quality.

### 2. Collaborative Message Approval

- **Co-author Review**: Co-authors have a 7-day window to approve or deny the submitted message.
- **Unanimous Approval**: All co-authors approve, the message is published, and the contributor becomes a co-author.
- **Denial**: Any co-author rejects, the message is denied, and staked tokens are distributed among rejecting co-authors.
- **Split Decision**: Mixed approvals result in the message being denied, with tokens intended for approvers returning to the Choir Treasury.

### 3. Co-authorship Dynamics

- **Rights and Responsibilities**: Co-authors share in the thread's token balance and participate in future approvals.
- **Divestment Option**: Co-authors can choose to divest their token share from a thread at any time.

## Benefits of Proof of Text

- **Content Quality Assurance**: Collaborative approvals ensure only high-quality messages are published.
- **Incentivized Participation**: Token staking and distribution align user incentives with platform goals.
- **Spam Reduction**: Staking requirement deters low-quality or spam submissions.
- **Community Building**: Co-authorship fosters a sense of ownership and responsibility among users.

## AI-Generated Summaries and Source Linking

- **Accessibility**: Non-co-authors can access AI-generated summaries of threads, promoting transparency.
- **Citation Notifications**: When messages are cited elsewhere, a special notification appears in the original thread.
- **Source Linking**: Cited messages include links to their original chat thread, enhancing interconnectivity.

## Challenges and Considerations

- **Approval Delays**: Implementing reasonable time frames (e.g., 24-hour windows) and notifications can mitigate delays.
- **Staking Amounts**: Balancing accessibility and deterrence of spam requires careful adjustment of staking requirements.
- **Scalability**: Ensuring the platform can handle increased activity without compromising performance.

## Conclusion

The Proof of Text mechanism is integral to **Choir**'s mission to foster a high-quality, collaborative content ecosystem through chat-based interactions. By leveraging blockchain technology and tokenomics, Choir ensures that content creation and curation are both rewarding and aligned with community standards.
