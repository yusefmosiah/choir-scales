# Choir: Comprehensive Project Overview

VERSION comprehensive_system:
  invariants: {
    "Token-driven quality control",
    "Collaborative ownership model",
    "Dual-state architecture"
  }
  assumptions: {
    "Development timeline",
    "Integration patterns",
    "Scaling approach"
  }
  implementation: "0.1.0"

## Vision and Mission

ASSUMPTION platform_evolution:
  "Initial focus on text-based chat"
  "May expand to other content types"
  "Must maintain quality-first approach"

Choir envisions a future where artificial intelligence seamlessly integrates the nuanced, creative, and contextual aspects of human communication. Our mission is to create the world's highest signal human dataset by leveraging a decentralized, token-driven chat platform, ultimately developing AI models that excel in qualitative, stylistic, and artistic dimensions.

## Core Concept and Problem Statement

ASSUMPTION quality_metrics:
  "Implicit quality through stake/approval"
  "May introduce explicit metrics"
  "Must maintain organic curation"

Traditional AI models demonstrate impressive technical capabilities but lack the qualitative nuances that characterize human expression. Content generated by these models often fails to capture stylistic nuance, artistic flair, and meaningful context, resulting in a disconnect with human audiences.

Choir addresses these challenges by creating a decentralized, chat-based platform where users engage in collaborative discussions. Messages are curated through a collective approval mechanism, ensuring only high-quality content is published. By integrating blockchain technology and innovative tokenomics, Choir incentivizes users to produce valuable content, fostering an ecosystem that prioritizes quality over quantity.

## Key Features and Mechanics

ASSUMPTION feature_set:
  "Core ownership and approval features"
  "May add advanced governance"
  "Must maintain simplicity of use"

### 1. Collaborative Message Ownership and Approval
- Users own the messages they submit.
- Threads are owned collectively by the creators of the messages within them (co-authors).
- Messages require unanimous approval from co-authors to be published.
- The initial thread creator is the first co-author.

### 2. Speculative Responses ("Specs")
- Non-co-authors can pay CHOIR tokens to submit a speculative response ("spec") to a thread.
- Co-authors have a 7-day window to approve or deny the spec.
- If approved unanimously, the spec is published, and the contributor becomes a co-author.
- If denied, the spec is rejected, and rejecting co-authors split the staked tokens.

### 3. Access Control and Incentivization
- Co-authors have full read-write access to their threads.
- Non-co-authors can view AI-generated summaries of threads.
- All chat threads are accessible at `choir.chat/stream/<thread_id>`.
- Ownership enables access control and distribution of CHOIR token rewards.

### 4. CHOIR Token Mechanics
- Total Supply: 10 billion CHOIR tokens (fixed supply)
- Used for staking, rewarding contributions, and aligning incentives
- Threads have Solana accounts that store CHOIR tokens
- Token distribution based on message approvals and denials
- When a new message is approved, staked tokens go to the thread's token balance
- When a message is denied:
  - Rejecting co-authors split the staked tokens
  - Any approvers get nothing
  - Remaining tokens go to the Choir Treasury

### 5. AI-Generated Summaries
- Non-co-authors access AI-generated summaries of threads
- Summaries designed to create interest and stimulate engagement
- Compress content to tease the full discussion
- Will improve over time but are not intended as strict privacy measures

## Proof of Text Mechanism

Choir introduces a novel consensus mechanism known as **Proof of Text** to ensure content integrity, foster collaboration, and align incentives within its decentralized ecosystem.

### Key Components of Proof of Text

1. **Message Contribution and Staking**
   - Users stake a predefined amount of CHOIR tokens to submit messages or specs to threads where they are not co-authors.
   - Purpose: Discourages spam and ensures contributors have a vested interest in the thread's quality.

2. **Collaborative Message Approval**
   - Co-author Review: Co-authors have a 7-day window to approve or deny the submitted message or spec.
   - Unanimous Approval: All co-authors approve, the message is published, and the contributor becomes a co-author.
   - Denial: Any co-author rejects, the message is denied, and staked tokens are distributed among rejecting co-authors.
   - Split Decision: Mixed approvals result in the message being denied, with tokens intended for approvers returning to the Choir Treasury.

3. **Co-authorship Dynamics**
   - Rights and Responsibilities: Co-authors share in the thread's token balance and participate in future approvals.
   - Divestment Option: Co-authors can choose to divest their token share from a thread at any time, receiving a proportional share of the thread's tokens.

## Technical Architecture

### 1. Frontend
- Next.js-based web application
- React components for UI elements
- Solana wallet integration
- Tailwind CSS for styling

### 2. Backend
- FastAPI (Python) for API endpoints
- WebSocket support for real-time chat

- Custom smart contracts for thread token management

### 4. AI Layer
- Azure OpenAI for embeddings and completions
- Custom AI model development (target: April 2025)

## Chorus Loop

The Chorus Loop is a decision-making model implemented in the platform:

1. **Action**: Provide an initial response to the user's prompt with "beginner's mind"/emptiness.
2. **Experience**: Search memory for relevant context to refine the initial response.
3. **Intention**: Analyze planned actions and consider potential consequences.
4. **Observation**: Reflect on the analysis and intentions, identifying gaps in knowledge or potential biases.
5. **Update**: Decide whether to proceed with the current plan or loop back for further refinement.
6. **Yield**: Synthesize the accumulated context from all iterations and provide a final response.

## Ownership Model

1. **Message Ownership**: Each message is owned by its creator.
2. **Thread Ownership**: Threads are owned collectively by co-authors (creators of the messages within them).
3. **Co-authorship**:
   - Co-authors have full read-write access to the thread.
   - New co-authors are added when their messages are approved and published in the thread.
   - No limitations on the number of co-authors a thread can have.

## Token Flow Mechanics

1. **Message Contribution and Staking**: Users stake CHOIR tokens to submit messages or specs.
2. **Approval Process**:
   - Unanimous Approval: Staked tokens added to thread's balance.
   - Denial: Rejecting co-authors split staked tokens.
3. **Divestment**: Co-authors can divest their token share from a thread at any time, taking a (1 / n - 1) share of the thread's CHOIR tokens.

# Convergent Context Creation

VERSION context_system:
  invariants: {
    "Emergence guidance",
    "Convergence patterns",
    "Context coherence"
  }
  assumptions: {
    "LLM behavior",
    "Human-AI interaction",

- Productive exploration spaces
- Coherent understanding
- Value-generating insights
- Emergent capabilities

## Value Creation

The ability to create convergent contexts becomes increasingly valuable as:
- LLMs become more powerful
- Complexity increases
- Emergence accelerates
- Value patterns evolve

## Context Design

Effective convergent contexts:
- Build on existing patterns
- Allow natural evolution
- Guide without constraining
- Enable emergence while maintaining coherence

Through careful context creation, we can guide emergence while preserving its essential spontaneity.

# Harmonic Economic Model

VERSION harmonic_economic:
invariants: {
"Wave energy conservation",
"Value resonance patterns",
"Token flow coherence"
}
assumptions: {
"Resonant pricing",
"Phase-locked incentives",
"Harmonic distribution"
}
implementation: "0.1.0"

## Token Flow as Wave Mechanics

TYPE TokenFlow = {
treasury: ResonantWell,                  // Base frequency source
threads: Map<ThreadId, StandingWave>,    // Resonant cavities
stakes: Map<Hash, WavePacket>,           // Energy quanta
escrow: Map<Hash, PotentialWell>         // Temporary coupling
}

## Bonding Curve Mechanics

The core pricing function derives from quantum harmonic oscillator:
```
P(q) = S₀[1/2 + 1/(exp(ℏω/kT)-1)]

where:
- S₀: Base stake quantum (100 CHOIR)
- ω: Thread frequency (activity level)
- T: Thread temperature (volatility)
- ℏ: Platform coupling constant
```

This creates:
1. **Entry Price (Bid)**
   ```typescript
   function calculateStakeRequired(thread: Thread): number {
     const ω = measureThreadActivity(thread)
     const T = measureThreadVolatility(thread)
     return S₀ * (0.5 + 1/(Math.exp(ω/T) - 1))
   }
   ```

2. **Exit Amount (Divestment)**
   ```typescript
   function calculateDivestmentAmount(thread: Thread): number {
     const E = thread.tokenBalance    // Total energy
     const n = thread.coAuthors.length // Oscillator count
     return E * (1/(n-1))            // Energy redistribution
   }
   ```

## Incentive Resonance

1. **Stake Harmonics**
   ```
   PROPERTY stake_resonance:
     stake_energy > noise_threshold AND
     stake_energy < resonant_ceiling AND
     stake_energy ∝ thread_amplitude
   ```

2. **Reward Distribution**
   ```
   FUNCTION distribute_energy(action: Action) -> TokenAmount:
     MATCH action:
       Deny → energy/deniers_count        // Equal energy split
       Approve → energy/oscillator_count  // Phase-locked distribution
       Divest → total_energy/(n-1)       // Harmonic redistribution
   ```

## Game Theoretic Harmonics

1. **Strategy Space**
   ```
   TYPE Strategy =
     | NaturalResonance    // Align with thread harmonics
     | ForceDissonance     // Attempt artificial patterns
     | QualityOscillation  // Maintain phase coherence
     | CollectiveHarmony   // Synchronized denial
   ```

2. **Nash Equilibrium**
   ```
   PROPERTY equilibrium:
     FORALL oscillators, modes:
       energy(NaturalResonance) > energy(ForceDissonance) AND
       energy(QualityOscillation) > energy(RandomPhase) AND
       energy(CollectiveHarmony) > energy(UnilateralNoise)
   ```

## Economic Invariants

1. **Energy Conservation**
   ```
   INVARIANT wave_conservation:
     treasury_energy + sum(thread_energy) + sum(stake_energy) = TOTAL_SUPPLY
   ```

2. **Resonant Stability**
   ```
   INVARIANT phase_stability:
     FORALL thread IN threads:
       resonant(thread) ⟹
         stable_amplitude(thread) AND
         coherent_phase(thread) AND
         conserved_energy(thread)
   ```

## Market Dynamics

1. **Thread Resonance**
   ```
   FUNCTION calculate_thread_resonance(thread: Thread) -> Amplitude:
     FACTORS:
       oscillator_count    // Co-author coupling
       message_frequency   // Activity resonance
       token_amplitude     // Energy level
       phase_coherence     // Quality metric
   ```

2. **Dynamic Tuning**
   ```
   FUNCTION tune_resonance(thread: Thread) -> StakeAmount:
     resonance = calculate_thread_resonance(thread)
     RETURN base_quantum * resonance_factor(resonance)
   ```

## Example Scenarios

1. **New Thread**
   ```typescript
   const newThread = {
     messageRate: 2,        // Low frequency
     coAuthorCount: 2,      // Few oscillators
     tokenBalance: 500,     // Low energy
     approvalRate: 1.0,     // Perfect phase
     ageInDays: 1          // High temperature
   }
   // Results in low stake (~75 CHOIR)
   ```

2. **Active Thread**
   ```typescript
   const activeThread = {
     messageRate: 20,       // High frequency
     coAuthorCount: 10,     // Many oscillators
     tokenBalance: 10000,   // High energy
     approvalRate: 0.8,     // Good phase coherence
     ageInDays: 30         // Stable temperature
   }
   // Results in higher stake (~300 CHOIR)
   ```

Through this harmonic economic model, we see how:
- Value flows follow wave mechanics
- Prices emerge from resonant patterns
- Incentives align through phase-locking
- Stability comes from natural harmonics

The model creates an economic system that:
- Rewards authentic participation
- Dampens artificial behavior
- Enables natural value flow
- Maintains system coherence

- But they work as a holistic system
- Each "optimization" reduces value
- Competitors see parts, miss whole

From a User Perspective:
- Initial experience feels natural
- Value becomes clear through use
- Understanding deepens organically
- Alternatives feel increasingly shallow

From a Market Perspective:
- Low barrier to basic competition
- Insurmountable barrier to true replication
- Network effects compound understanding
- Value gap widens over time

## Medium Timeframe

From an Economic Perspective:
- Simple rules create complex value
- Attempts to extract value destroy it
- Natural selection for genuine participation
- Premium through apparent underpricing

From a Social Perspective:
- Trust networks form naturally
- Community understanding compounds
- Shared context creates value
- Relationships resist commodification

From a Technical Perspective:
- Quantum properties emerge
- System coherence strengthens
- State space enriches
- Topology becomes irreplicable

## Long Timeframe

From an Evolutionary Perspective:
- System learns from itself
- Understanding deepens recursively
- New capabilities emerge naturally
- Moat gets deeper autonomously

From a Cultural Perspective:
- Shared understanding evolves
- Community wisdom accumulates
- Value creation patterns mature
- Collective intelligence grows

From a Philosophical Perspective:
- Quantum semantics manifest
- Meaning and value entangle
- Natural selection operates

## Cross-Cutting Properties

The moat is:
- Self-reinforcing (gets deeper with use)
- Multi-dimensional (works at all levels)
- Naturally evolving (grows without effort)
- Anti-fragile (strengthens under attack)

## Competitive Implications

Attempts to compete through:
- Feature copying (misses the system)

- Social engineering (breaks emergence)
- Technical sophistication (adds friction)
All strengthen Choir's advantage

## Future Evolution

The moat will:
- Deepen through natural use
- Expand through emergence
- Strengthen through selection
- Complexify through interaction

This protection isn't designed - it emerges naturally from the system's fundamental properties, making it both effortless to maintain and impossible to truly replicate.

# Choir Tokenomics Whitepaper

## Abstract

Choir introduces an innovative socioeconomic media network that leverages blockchain technology to redefine collaborative communication and content curation. Central to Choir's ecosystem is the **Choir Token (CHOIR)**, a cryptocurrency meticulously designed to incentivize meaningful contributions, foster high-quality interactions, and promote collaborative decision-making within chat threads. This whitepaper delineates the comprehensive tokenomics of Choir, elucidating the mechanisms of token staking, message approval, and economic incentives that underpin user engagement and platform sustainability.

## Introduction

The digital communication landscape often faces challenges related to content quality, spam, and lack of meaningful collaboration. Traditional platforms struggle with moderation and incentive alignment, leading to environments where high-quality discourse is undervalued.

**Choir** addresses these challenges by creating a decentralized chat-based platform where users engage in collaborative discussions, and co-authors collectively manage content through an approval mechanism. By integrating blockchain technology and a thoughtfully designed token economy, Choir incentivizes users to contribute valuable messages, engage responsibly, and invest in the platform's growth.

## Token Overview

- **Token Name**: Choir Token
- **Token Symbol**: CHOIR
- **Total Supply**: 10,000,000,000 (10 billion) tokens (Hard Cap)
- **Token Standard**: Solana Program Library (SPL) Token
- **Initial Allocation**: All 10 billion tokens minted to the Choir Treasury at genesis

## Key Entities in the Choir Ecosystem

### 1. Choir Treasury

- **Description**: The central repository holding the entire initial supply of CHOIR tokens.
- **Functionality**:
  - Distributes tokens as rewards and handles token recapture from split decisions.
  - Maintains the economic balance of the platform by controlling token flow.

### 2. Users

- **Description**: Participants who contribute messages to chat threads and engage in the collaborative ecosystem.
- **Functionality**:
  - Stake tokens to contribute messages to threads where they are not co-authors.
  - Become co-authors upon approval of their messages, gaining rights and token shares.
  - Submit speculative responses ("specs") to threads they're not co-authors of.

### 3. Chat Threads

- **Description**: Collaborative spaces where users engage in discussions.
- **Functionality**:
  - Managed by co-authors who approve or deny incoming messages and specs.
  - Accumulate tokens through contributions and approvals.
  - Have dedicated Solana accounts for token storage.

### 4. Message Approval Mechanism

- **Description**: A consensus system where co-authors collectively decide on the inclusion of messages.
- **Functionality**:
  - Messages require unanimous approval from co-authors to be published.
  - Denied messages result in staked tokens being distributed among rejecting co-authors.

## Token Flow Mechanics

### 1. Message Contribution and Staking

- **Process**:
  - A user wishes to contribute a message to a chat thread where they are not a co-author.
  - The user stakes a predefined amount of CHOIR tokens as part of the message submission.
- **Token Allocation**:
  - Staked tokens are held in an escrow contract during the approval process.

### 2. Message Approval Process

- **Review Window**: Co-authors have a 7-day period to review and decide on the message.
- **Approval Mechanism**:
  - **Unanimous Approval**: All co-authors approve; the message is published.
    - **Token Distribution**:
      - The staked tokens are added to the thread's token balance.
      - The message author becomes a co-author, sharing in the thread's token balance and approval rights.
  - **Denial**:
    - Any co-author rejects; the message is denied.
    - **Token Distribution**:
      - Rejecting co-authors split the staked tokens equally.
  - **Split Decision**:
    - If there is a mix of approvals and denials, tokens intended for approving co-authors are returned to the Choir Treasury.
    - The message is denied.

### 3. Tokens and Co-authorship

- **Co-authorship Rights**:
  - Upon becoming a co-author, users share in the thread's token balance and have the power to approve or deny future messages.
- **Divestment Mechanism**:
  - Co-authors can choose to divest their share of tokens from a thread at any time.
  - **Token Retrieval**: An author receives a proportional share of the thread's token balance upon divestment.

### 4. Messages as Assets

- **Content Ownership**:
  - Messages and threads are treated as valuable assets within the platform.
- **Economic Incentives**:
  - Users are motivated to contribute high-quality messages to become co-authors.
  - The staking requirement discourages spam and ensures users have a vested interest in the thread's quality.

## Preventing Token Inflation and Ensuring Sustainability

### Fixed Token Supply

- **Hard Cap**: The total supply of 10 billion CHOIR tokens ensures scarcity and maintains token value.

### Token Recapture

- **Mechanism**: Tokens from split decisions (where messages are denied with mixed approvals) are returned to the Choir Treasury.
- **Purpose**: Sustains future distributions and prevents unchecked token circulation.

### Dynamic Staking Requirements

- **Adjustments**:
  - Staking amounts may vary based on platform activity levels.
  - Helps maintain accessibility while discouraging low-quality contributions.

## Citation Mechanics and Source Linking

### Message Citations

- **Citation Notifications**:
  - When a message is cited as a source elsewhere, a special notification message appears in the original thread.
- **Source Linking**:
  - Cited messages include a link to their original chat thread.
  - Enhances interconnectivity and acknowledgment of contributors.

### AI-Generated Summaries

- **Public Accessibility**:
