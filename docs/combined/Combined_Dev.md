# AI-Assisted Formal Methods Evolution

VERSION ai_formal_system:
  invariants: {
    "Proof correctness",
    "Model consistency",
    "Human verifiability"
  }
  assumptions: {
    "AI capability growth",
    "Formal methods tooling",
    "Hybrid verification approaches"
  }
  implementation: "0.1.0"

## Current State to Future Vision

Our current pseudocode conventions and formal methods approach deliberately bridges human understanding with machine verification. As AI capabilities evolve, we anticipate a gradual transformation where AI assists in both directions: helping humans write more precise specifications and helping machines understand informal requirements.

## Emerging Capabilities

We expect AI to increasingly help with:

State Space Exploration - AI could identify edge cases and invariant violations by exploring possible state transitions more thoroughly than manual analysis.

Property Inference - Rather than just verifying stated properties, AI could suggest additional properties it observes in the system specification.

Proof Generation - AI could propose formal proofs of system properties, while maintaining human verifiability of the proof steps.

Implementation Verification - AI could verify that implementations match their formal specifications, identifying subtle discrepancies.

## Hybrid Verification Approach

The future isn't pure AI verification, but rather a hybrid approach where:

Human Intent remains the source of truth for what the system should do.
AI assists in formalizing these intentions into precise specifications.
Automated tools verify the specifications against implementations.
Human review validates that the verified system matches original intent.

## Evolution of Documentation

Our documentation should evolve to support this transition:

Formal Specifications will become more complete as AI helps identify gaps.
Proof Obligations will be automatically generated and verified.
Implementation Guidance will include AI-verified correctness criteria.
Testing Strategies will incorporate AI-generated test cases from formal specs.

## Maintaining Human Understanding

As verification becomes more automated, we must maintain:

Clarity of Intent - Specifications must still clearly communicate human goals.
Verifiable Reasoning - AI-generated proofs must be human-checkable.
Traceable Properties - System properties must link to business requirements.
Comprehensible Models - State machines and transitions must remain intuitive.

## Practical Steps

To prepare for this evolution:

Keep formal specifications machine-readable but human-understandable.
Maintain clear separation between specification and implementation.
Document assumptions about AI capabilities explicitly.
Build verification tooling that can incorporate AI assistance.

## Research Directions

Key areas to watch and experiment with:

Natural Language to Formal Specs - AI translation of requirements.
Automated Property Discovery - AI inference of system invariants.
Proof Assistant Integration - AI-powered formal verification tools.
Implementation Synthesis - AI generation of verified implementations.

## Risks and Mitigations

We must carefully manage:

Specification Drift - Ensure AI-enhanced specs match human intent.
Proof Complexity - Keep verification steps humanly verifiable.
Tool Dependencies - Maintain ability to verify without AI when needed.
Knowledge Transfer - Document AI-assisted verification decisions.

## Future Documentation Structure

Our documentation should evolve to include:

AI-Assisted Sections - Clearly marked AI-generated content.
Verification Reports - AI-generated proof summaries.
Property Catalogs - Both human-specified and AI-discovered properties.
Implementation Mappings - AI-verified spec-to-code correspondence.

## Integration Timeline

We envision a gradual integration:

Phase 1 (Current) - Human-written specs with traditional verification
Phase 2 (Near) - AI-assisted specification writing and property discovery
Phase 3 (Medium) - AI-generated proofs with human verification
Phase 4 (Future) - Hybrid human-AI formal methods ecosystem

## Success Criteria

The success of AI integration into formal methods will be measured by:

Specification Completeness - More comprehensive formal models
Verification Speed - Faster property checking and proof generation
Error Detection - Earlier discovery of specification issues
Human Understanding - Maintained or improved specification clarity

Through careful evolution of our formal methods approach, we can leverage emerging AI capabilities while maintaining the rigor and understanding that formal methods provide.

# Chorus Development Plan

VERSION chorus_system:
  invariants: {
    "AEIOU(Y) loop structure",
    "Source integration requirements",
    "Token-aware citations"
  }
  assumptions: {
    "AI model capabilities",
    "Response generation patterns",
    "Source handling methods"
  }
  implementation: "0.1.0"

## Overview

ASSUMPTION ai_integration:
  "Current LLM integration patterns"
  "May evolve with new AI capabilities"
  "Must maintain response quality"

This document outlines the development plan for enhancing the Chorus loop, focusing on improving source handling, integration, and presentation throughout the process.

## Chorus Loop Steps

ASSUMPTION loop_structure:
  "Six-step AEIOU(Y) process"
  "May introduce parallel processing"
  "Must maintain logical progression"

### 1. Action Step
- User input initiates the process
- Provide an initial response with "beginner's mind"/emptiness

### 2. Experience Step
- Retrieve the full list of sources from the database
- Pass the complete source list to the LLM along with the user's input
- LLM processes this information for subsequent steps
- Include user's co-authorship status for relevant threads

### 3. Intention Step
- Receive full source list and user input from the Experience step
- For each source, determine relevance and flag as "relevant" or "not relevant"
- Return a list of sources with their relevance flags
- Consider co-authorship status when determining relevance

### 4. Observation Step
- Select the most valuable sources from the set of relevant sources identified in the Intention step
- Determine which sources will be used in the final response
- Ensure selected sources align with the user's access rights based on co-authorship

### 5. Update Step
- Decide whether to proceed with the current plan or loop back for further refinement
- Include token staking mechanism for non-co-authors submitting speculative responses ("specs")

### 6. Yield Step
- Compose the final response, weaving in valuable sources identified in the Observation step
- Create source references as links to original chat threads
- For non-co-authors of a source thread, display source content between two short AI-generated summaries of the content before and after it
- Include information about token distribution for approved messages and specs

## Implementation Timeline

# Choir Pseudocode Conventions

VERSION pseudocode_system:
  invariants: {
    "Functional clarity",
    "Type safety",
    "Pattern consistency"
  }
  assumptions: {
    "Reader familiarity with functional concepts",
    "Implementation language agnostic",
    "Documentation-first development"
  }
  implementation: "0.1.0"

## Core Philosophy

Our pseudocode serves as a bridge between formal specification and implementation. It combines functional programming's precision with readable syntax to create unambiguous yet accessible descriptions of system behavior.

## Type Declarations

Type declarations define the shape of data and enforce semantic boundaries. We use the TYPE keyword followed by the type name and its definition. Simple types can be records with named fields, each with its own type. Sum types (variants) use the pipe symbol to separate cases, each optionally containing data.

For example, a thread state would declare co-authors as a Set of PublicKeys, a token balance as a TokenAmount, and messages as a List of Message types. Results are typically wrapped in a Result type that can be either Ok with success data or Error with error information.

## Function Signatures

Functions declare their types explicitly to make data flow clear. The FUNCTION keyword introduces a function, followed by its name, input parameters with their types, and return type after an arrow. Parameter lists maintain clear type annotations for each parameter.

## Pattern Matching

Pattern matching expresses complex conditional logic through the MATCH keyword, followed by the value being matched and a series of patterns and their corresponding actions. Each pattern can destructure complex data types and bind variables for use in the result expression.

## Monadic Operations

For operations that involve state or effects, we use monadic notation. The BIND operator (often written as >>=) chains operations, while RETURN lifts pure values into the effect context. This makes side effects explicit and composable.

## Invariant Declarations

System invariants use the INVARIANT keyword followed by a name and a predicate that must hold. These can appear in type definitions, function specifications, or standalone assertions about system properties.

## Property Specifications

Properties about the system use the PROPERTY keyword followed by a name and a specification. These often use quantifiers (FORALL, EXISTS) and logical operators to express complex requirements.

## Sequence Declarations

For ordered operations, the SEQUENCE keyword introduces a named sequence of steps. Each step can reference results from previous steps and produce values for subsequent ones.

## Verification Conditions

When specifying correctness conditions, the VERIFY keyword introduces properties that must be checked. These can appear within functions or as standalone proof obligations.

## Error Handling

Error cases use the REQUIRE keyword for preconditions and the ENSURE keyword for postconditions. The Result type explicitly handles success and failure cases in return values.

## State Transitions

State machine transitions use arrow notation (→) with optional conditions in square brackets. The before and after states are explicitly labeled, with transition conditions when needed.

## Documentation Comments

Each construct should be documented with its purpose, assumptions, and any special considerations. These appear as prose before the construct they describe.

## Implementation Notes

The NOTE keyword introduces implementation-specific details or considerations that don't affect the formal specification but are important for developers.

## Evolution Patterns

The ASSUMPTION keyword documents aspects of the system that may change, including rationale for current choices and constraints on future changes.

## Usage Guidelines

This pseudocode style should be used consistently across all technical documentation. It provides a common language for expressing both formal properties and practical implementations while maintaining readability for all stakeholders.

Through these conventions, we create documentation that serves as both specification and guide, bridging the gap between formal methods and practical development.

}   `

3.  **Instruction Fuzzing** ```rust
    impl FuzzInstruction {
    fn get_accounts(&self) -> Result<Vec<AccountMeta>> {
    // Account validation and meta generation
    }

        fn get_data(&self) -> Result<Vec<u8>> {
            // Instruction data generation
        }
