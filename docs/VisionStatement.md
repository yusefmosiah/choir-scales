## 1. Introduction

The rapid evolution of AI has ushered in an era where machines can perform complex tasks with remarkable efficiency. Yet, despite these advancements, AI-generated content often lacks the depth, creativity, and artistic flair that characterize human expression. Traditional AI models excel in generating technically accurate and contextually relevant content but fall short in embodying the qualitative subtleties that make content truly impactful.

**Choir** seeks to bridge this gap by creating a platform where content quality is meticulously measured and rewarded, fostering an ecosystem that not only values but also cultivates high-quality, artistically rich content. By integrating blockchain technology and innovative tokenomics, Choir incentivizes users to produce and curate content that stands out in both relevance and artistic merit.

4. **Edit Escrow Contracts**
   - **Role**: Temporary holding of tokens during the edit proposal process.
   - **Function**: Manage the staking and distribution of tokens based on edit approval or denial outcomes.

5. **Content Accounts**
   - **Role**: Blockchain accounts representing individual pieces of content.
   - **Function**: Store the token score of content; maintain records of co-authors and their token shares; accumulate tokens to enhance content visibility.

6. **Qdrant Vector Database**
   - **Role**: Storage and retrieval of content and embeddings.
   - **Function**: Enables semantic search and efficient content management.

### 4.2 Token Flow Mechanics

1. **Initial Allocation**
   - **Minting**: 10 billion CHOIR tokens are minted to the Choir Treasury at platform inception.
   - **Distribution**: Tokens flow from the Treasury to users as rewards for content creation and citations.

2. **Content Creation**
   - **Reward Structure**: Users earn tokens based on the semantic sparsity of their content.
   - **Semantic Sparsity Factor**: Higher rewards for content that is unique and occupies a sparse semantic space.
   - **Token Allocation**: A portion of the reward is allocated to the content creator, and another portion is distributed to authors of cited content.

3. **Automatic Citation**
   - **Process**: Upon content creation, the system automatically cites relevant existing content.
   - **Rewards**: Cited authors receive tokens proportional to the relevance and uniqueness of their content.

4. **Collaborative Editing**
   - **Edit Proposals**: Users propose edits by staking tokens in an edit escrow contract.
   - **Approval Process**: Co-authors have 7 days to approve or reject the edit; abstention counts as approval.
   - **Token Distribution**:
     - **Approval**: Staked tokens are transferred to the content account, and the editor becomes a co-author.
     - **Denial**: Staked tokens are distributed to rejecting authors.
   - **Divestment**: Authors can divest their share of tokens from the content account, receiving a proportional amount based on the number of co-authors.

5. **Token Recapture**
   - **Mechanism**: Tokens from split edit decisions (non-unanimous outcomes) are recaptured by the Choir Treasury, sustaining future distributions.

### 4.3 Divestment Mechanism

- **Process**: Authors can choose to divest their share of tokens from a content account at any time.
- **Token Retrieval Formula**:

  \[
  \text{Tokens Received} = \frac{\text{Content Account Tokens}}{n - 1}
  \]

  - \( n \): Total number of co-authors.

- **Examples**:
  - **7 Authors**: Divesting author receives \( \frac{\text{Content Tokens}}{6} \).
  - **2 Authors**: Divesting author receives all tokens, leaving the remaining author with an empty account.

### 4.4 Economic Gamification

- **Buyable Assets**: Content can be invested in through collaborative editing, representing shared ownership.
- **Sellable Assets**: Authors can divest their share, transferring control to those who value the content's future.
- **Hot Potato Dynamics**: Encourages active investment and discourages passive ownership, promoting a dynamic content ecosystem.
