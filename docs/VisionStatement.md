# Choir Big Picture Vision Document

---

## Abstract

As artificial intelligence (AI) continues to advance, the focus has predominantly been on quantitative and technical improvements. However, qualitative aspects—such as stylistic nuance, artistic expression, and the ability to generate high-signal, meaningful content—remain areas ripe for innovation. **Choir** envisions a transformative approach to AI development by leveraging a decentralized, token-driven socioeconomic media network. Through its unique tokenomics and collaborative content curation mechanisms, Choir aims to create the world's highest signal human dataset. This dataset will serve as the foundation for training AI models that excel not only in technical prowess but also in qualitative, stylistic, and artistic dimensions. Our chief objective is to develop the first iteration of an AI model, utilizing reinforcement learning (RL) with this token-scored data, by **April 27, 2025**.

## 1. Introduction

The rapid evolution of AI has ushered in an era where machines can perform complex tasks with remarkable efficiency. Yet, despite these advancements, AI-generated content often lacks the depth, creativity, and artistic flair that characterize human expression. Traditional AI models excel in generating technically accurate and contextually relevant content but fall short in embodying the qualitative subtleties that make content truly impactful.

**Choir** seeks to bridge this gap by creating a platform where content quality is meticulously measured and rewarded, fostering an ecosystem that not only values but also cultivates high-quality, artistically rich content. By integrating blockchain technology and innovative tokenomics, Choir incentivizes users to produce and curate content that stands out in both relevance and artistic merit.

Choir operates as both a decentralized community and a corporate entity. This dual structure allows us to harness the innovative potential of decentralization while leveraging the strategic advantages of a traditional corporation. Our vision includes integrating the corporate and decentralized elements, where the corporation owns the CHOIR token, and the Choir Treasury eventually holds tokenized corporate stock.

## 2. The Problem: Quantitative vs. Qualitative AI Advancements

### 2.1 Current Landscape

AI models have made significant strides in improving the quantitative aspects of content generation—such as grammar, coherence, and factual accuracy. However, they often lack the ability to infuse content with artistic expression, cultural relevance, and stylistic nuances that resonate deeply with human audiences.

### 2.2 Shortcomings of Existing Models

- **Lack of Artistic Flair**: AI-generated content may be technically sound but often misses the creative spark that makes content engaging.
- **Contextual Limitations**: Existing models struggle with understanding and incorporating complex cultural and contextual cues.
- **Engagement Deficit**: While content may be informative, it often fails to inspire, provoke thought, or evoke emotional responses.

### 2.3 Opportunity for Innovation

There is a pressing need to develop AI models that not only comprehend and generate content but also excel in creating meaningful, impactful, and artistically rich narratives. By focusing on qualitative improvements, AI can achieve a higher level of interaction and influence in the digital media landscape.

## 4. How Choir Works

### 4.1 Ecosystem Components

1. **Chorus AI System**
   - **Role**: Core AI system for content analysis and generation.
   - **Function**: Implements a multi-step process (Action, Experience, Intention, Observation, Update, and Yield) for AI-driven interactions.

2. **Choir Treasury**
   - **Role**: Centralized repository holding the initial supply of 10 billion CHOIR tokens.
   - **Function**: Distributes tokens to users as rewards for content creation and automatic citations; recaptures tokens from split edit decisions.

3. **Users**
   - **Role**: Content creators, editors, and curators.
   - **Function**: Earn tokens through content creation, citations, and collaborative editing; invest tokens into content accounts; divest tokens by relinquishing authorship.

4. **Edit Escrow Contracts**
   - **Role**: Temporary holding of tokens during the edit proposal process.
   - **Function**: Manage the staking and distribution of tokens based on edit approval or denial outcomes.

5. **Content Accounts**
   - **Role**: Blockchain accounts representing individual pieces of content.
   - **Function**: Store the token score of content; maintain records of co-authors and their token shares; accumulate tokens to enhance content visibility.

6. **Qdrant Vector Database**
   - **Role**: Storage and retrieval of content and embeddings.
   - **Function**: Enables semantic search and efficient content management.

### 4.2 Token Flow Mechanics

1. **Initial Allocation**
   - **Minting**: 10 billion CHOIR tokens are minted to the Choir Treasury at platform inception.
   - **Distribution**: Tokens flow from the Treasury to users as rewards for content creation and citations.

2. **Content Creation**
   - **Rewards**: Users receive tokens based on the uniqueness and quality of their content.
   - **Investment**: Tokens are also allocated to the content account to enhance visibility and attract collaboration.

3. **Automatic Citation**
   - **Mechanism**: When content cites existing works, tokens are automatically distributed to the authors of the cited content.

4. **Collaborative Editing**
   - **Edit Proposals**: Users propose edits by staking tokens in an edit escrow contract.
   - **Approval Process**: Co-authors have 7 days to review the edit. A mix of approvals and abstentions (with no rejections) results in approval. If there are only abstentions, the edit is rejected.
   - **Token Distribution**:
     - **Approval**: Staked tokens are transferred to the content account, and the editor becomes a co-author.
     - **Denial**: Staked tokens are distributed to rejecting authors or returned to the editor in case of abstention-only rejection.

5. **Token Recapture**
   - **Mechanism**: Tokens from split edit decisions (non-unanimous outcomes) are recaptured by the Choir Treasury, sustaining future distributions.

### 4.3 Divestment Mechanism

- **Process**: Authors can choose to divest their share of tokens from a content account at any time.
- **Token Retrieval Formula**:

  \[
  \text{Tokens Received} = \frac{\text{Content Account Tokens}}{n - 1}
  \]

  - \( n \): Total number of co-authors.

- **Examples**:
  - **7 Authors**: Divesting author receives \( \frac{\text{Content Tokens}}{6} \).
  - **2 Authors**: Divesting author receives all tokens, leaving the remaining author with an empty account.

### 4.4 Economic Gamification

- **Buyable Assets**: Content can be invested in through collaborative editing, representing shared ownership.
- **Sellable Assets**: Authors can divest their share, transferring control to those who value the content's future.
- **Hot Potato Dynamics**: Encourages active investment and discourages passive ownership, promoting a dynamic content ecosystem.
